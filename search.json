The workshop will once again welcome early career researchers (master, PhD, first postdoc) in archaeological sciences and cultural heritage studies.\nWith this workshop we aim to offer a relaxed atmosphere to encourage interdisciplinary exchange between early career researchers. With a hybrid format, we are happy to welcome participants in person, as well as those online from all around the world, who cannot come to Tübingen. We are pleased to invite you for oral contributions in all kinds of natural sciences about archaeological and anthropological topics. In particular, early career researchers in archaeology, art history, anthropology, biology, chemistry, conservation, cultural heritage, earth science, material science, medicine, physics are welcome to submit an abstract.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreliminary Program\n\n\n\nOct. 3rd\nEvening - Icebreaker\nOct. 4th\nMorning - Opening of the conference - Presentations\nAfternoon - Presentations\nOct. 5th\nDay - Presentations\nEvening - Dinner\nOct. 6th\nMorning - Presentations\nAfternoon - Round table - Closing of the conference"

    "text": "How to get to Tübingen\nTübingen is a university city in south-western Germany, at the centre of the state Baden-Württemberg. It is located ca. 30 km south of Stuttgart, the state capital.\nYou can easily access Tübingen via direct train from Stuttgart central station (IRE6, MEX12, and MEX18), or via bus lines 828 and X82 from Stuttgart Airport (STR). You can find information about connections with trains and regional buses here. Several long distance bus lines operated by e.g. Flixbus stop at Tübingen. With a car you reach Tübingen best via the B27 and B28.\nYRA 2023 will take place in Hohentübingen Castle, in Tübingen’s historical city centre. Please be aware that the castle is located on a small but steep hill. Access for persons with reduced mobility is possible but require arrangements in advance regarding e.g. parking. Please contact us if this should be the case. We are happy to make all necessary arrangements for you."

We welcome all persons involved in archaeometry research of different nationalities and levels, from master students to first postdoctoral fellows.\nWith our mailing list, we offer ECRs an possibility to interact with each other between the workshops. While announced here as the major communication outlet for the YRA workshops beside the webpage, any subscriber is welcomed to use it for, e.g., sharing job advertisements, searching for collaborators, or having discussions about any topic related to archaeological sciences and/or being an early career researcher."

    "title": "Young Researchers in Archaeometry",
    "section": "The journey",
    "text": "The journey\nThe idea for the workshop was born in 2016 in an discussion about why so few ECRs are joining the German archaeological sciences conference “Archäometrie & Denkmalpflege” (Archaeometry & preservation of historic monuments). Beside the psychological barrier of delivering the first conference presentation in front of very distinguished researchers, it was realised that the archaeological sciences are often dispersed among many different institutes and work groups, making it very difficult for ECRs to get in contact with peers.\nSince the first workshop in Frankfurt in 2017, all YRA workshops stayed true to the original idea. While originally aiming for the German community, the workshops became soon orientated towards an international audience with about 50% of the participants in the second edition being internationals. Already in 2019, it became an international workshop series with being organised at an institution outside of Germany for the first time. The latest step is to purposefully keep the hybrid format to become more inclusive to colleagues unable to attend the workshop in person while keeping the benefits of in-person meetings for networking.\nWith every new edition, the structures for YRA became more and more professionalised. Beginning with the processing of abstracts and registration in 2019, followed by the logo, mail address and a first webpage in 2022 and resulting in this webpage and the mailing list in 2023. Consequently, workload shifted more and more towards the local organisation while templates now exist for most other tasks. This, and the active support from previous organisers whenever needed, makes the YRA workshops particularly suited to gather first experiences as workshop organiser. And it is what keeps YRA staying true to its motto: for ECRs by ECRs.\nIf you are interested in organising the next workshop or have ideas for additional events, please get in touch via mail."

    "section": "The YRA logo",
    "text": "The YRA logo\nDesigning a logo for YRA was not an easy task. Without doubt, the biggest challenge was to create a logo that represents the huge breadth of disciplines working together in the archaeological sciences and represents the target group. As a consequence, decisions were made for a very abstract logo and we are aware it is not very intuitive.\nThe logo writes “YRA” embedded in a spectra-like line with each letter having a different colour and the grey coloured parts as connecting lines. The trowel-shaped arrows outline the negative space (“hole”) of the letters R and A and are inspired by the markers for characteristic peaks. The colours do not have a special meaning. They were chosen because this combination is colour-blind friendly and pleasing to the eyes of the persons involved in the design process."
