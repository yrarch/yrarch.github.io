To address this, we conducted zooarchaeological and preliminary isotopic analyses (δ13C and δ15N) on faunal assemblages from three archaeological sites on the island. Our study aimed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the dietary strategies employed by the Majos and the role of environmental constraints in shaping subsistence practices.\nThe zooarchaeological evidence reveals a diverse spectrum of exploited fauna, including domestic animals, wild terrestrial species, and marine resources, suggesting a more diversified subsistence strategy than previously assumed. Isotopic analyses of terrestrial faunal remains display unusually high nitrogen values and positive carbon signatures, likely reflecting the arid conditions of Fuerteventura and the absence of significant mountainous regions, which influence local isotopic baselines. This research highlights the need to integrate human and faunal remains in isotopic studies to elucidate the complex interaction between environmental factors, subsistence strategies, and isotopic signatures in archaeological contexts.\n\nLeft: Las Palmas Zooarchaeological reference collection.

This is particularly the case for the rural economy, despite its evident importance to cultural developments within neighbouring regions. A small but growing body of scholarship is beginning to rectify this through bioarchaeological research aimed at reconstructing systems of farming and land use in the past. Focusing on the Aegean region of western Anatolia, I outline how these studies have transformed our understanding of agrarian lifeways and can shed new light on the dramatic cultural developments that can be traced across the Neolithic and Bronze Age. I go on to assess the implications of this regional trajectory for broader developments across the Aegean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 17th – Caroline Partiot (Austrian Archaeological Institute, Austria)\n\n\n\n\n\nTime: 12:00 pm (UTC)\nTitle: Life and death in Byzantine Ephesos (Turkey): contributions from the integration of archaeothanatological and biological data\nCo-authors: E. Baudoin, M. Steskal\nKeywords: Archaeothanatology; Biological anthropology; Funerary practices; Palaeopathology\nAbstract: The city of Ephesos, located in western Turkey, south of Izmir, was the capital of the Roman province of Asia and is home to one of the most significant sites of early Christianity: The Church of Mary. This monument served as an episcopal church in the early 5th and 6th centuries and later functioned as a burial ground during the Middle and Late Byzantine periods.\nIn 2023, a new excavation led by Dr. Martin Steskal aimed to document local burial practices using modern methodologies and archaeothanatological analysis. This approach focuses on closely examining post-depositional processes, such as anomalies in bone positioning and the sequence of joint decomposition. These analyses enable the reconstruction of the original organization of funerary spaces and a detailed interpretation of funerary practices. This field study is also being complemented by a comprehensive biological analysis of the entire collection recovered during previous excavations conducted between 1984 and 2001.\nThis presentation highlights the results of the study, which combines field data with the analysis of the biological profiles of the individuals. The archaeothanatological analysis uncovered previously undocumented funerary practices at the site, including specific secondary manipulations. Meanwhile, the biological analysis revealed a particularly compromised health status, characterized by probable staphylococcal infections and distinctive healed fractures. Together, these findings offer new perspectives on the life trajectories and funerary treatment of the individuals form this community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 6th – Alejandra Sánchez Polo (University of Valladolid, Spain)\n\n\n\n\n\nTime: 4:00 pm (UTC)\nTitle: Colored sculptures under study: archaeometrical and symbolic approaches to pigments in pre-Columbian Ecuador\nKeywords: Pigments; Pre-Columbian; Archaeometry; Museum; Ecuador\nAbstract: The pre-Columbian sculptures housed in art museums (such as the Quai Branly in Paris and the British Museum), decontextualized from their archaeological context, can still be historically relevant and provide insights into prehistoric societies? This question arose during my work as a curator at a pre-Columbian art museum in Ecuador. In addressing it, I pursued two main approaches: investigating the symbolism of colors and materials in pre-Columbian America and establishing the chaîne opératoire of the pigments observed on the shelves of the museum. To this end, several post-firing painted ceramic statues produced during the Regional Development period (500 BC - 500 AD) on the coast of Ecuador were studied.\nFirst, in order to delve into the chaîne opératoire, the pigments and chromatic layers were examined using binocular magnification, SEM, XRD, XRF, and Raman spectroscopy in collaboration with various Ecuadorian institutions. One of the findings was that, despite employing similar color schemes, these pigments were used in comparable ways but sourced from different pigment materials. Furthermore, there existed a profound symbolic connection regarding color across the Americas. Thus, this study sought to demonstrate that the thousands of artifacts in museums are amenable to archaeological study, reinstating their intrinsic historical value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 1st – Nicole Mittermair (Austrian Archaeological Institute & University of Vienna, Austria)\n\n\n\n\n\nTime: 12:00 pm (UTC)\nTitle: Identifying Bronze Age alloying practices in the western and central Balkans\nKeywords: Bronze Age Balkans; Trace element analysis; Alloying; Metal production\nAbstract: From 1500 BC onward, the increasing number of casting moulds, copper ingots, and hoards attests to a significant rise in metallurgical activity in the Western and Central Balkans. However, while Copper and Early Bronze Age metal production in the region has been extensively studied, the metallurgical practices of the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age have received far less attention.\nThis presentation will explore the elemental composition of Bronze Age copper-based objects from various archaeological contexts and discuss what these findings reveal about alloying practices, as one of the final stages in the metallurgical chaîne opératoire. Rather than focusing solely on raw material provenance, this study aims to reconstruct technological choices in metalworking practices and adaptations in local bronze production.\nThe goal of this study is to contextualize newly generated trace and minor element data (ED-XRF) within broader archaeological and chronological frameworks. Rather than focusing solely on raw material provenance, the emphasis lies on understanding deliberate technological choices in metallurgical practices, and adaptation in local bronze production. By integrating chemical data with cultural-historical perspectives, this research offers new insights into prehistoric metal production in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 9th – Additionnal Session - Evgenia Dammer (Berlin State Museums, Germany) & Romain Thomas (University of Sheffield, UK)\n\n\n\n\n\nWebinar\nTime: 2:00 pm (UTC)\nTitle: Discover STON: a practical tool to study petrographic images and beyond!\nAbstract: STON is open-source software designed to make microscopic image analysis faster and easier for archaeologists. Unlike existing microscopic imaging software, which is primarily built for the natural sciences, STON is tailored to archaeological research, allowing users to cluster and compare multiple images simultaneously in a simple, user-friendly workspace. With features such as freehand sorting and synchronised zoom, STON helps users efficiently group samples and analyse compositional characteristics. By streamlining these processes, it enhances ceramic paste analysis and petrographic grouping. Developed openly on GitHub, STON is free to use and fully adaptable, with a Python-based source code that can be customised for different projects.\nJoin this webinar to see STON in action and learn how it can support your research.\nFor more information, visit the documentation page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 16th – Doris Jetzinger (University of Vienna, Austria)\n\n\n\n\n\nTime: 9:00 am (UTC)\nTitle: Of landscape biographies and sediment archives: reconstructing the landscape history of the Kreuttal microregion in Lower Austria\nKeywords: Landscape biography; Sediment archive; Formation processes; Chronostratigraphy; Geochemistry\nAbstract: Just like people or physical objects, landscapes have life histories that are shaped by past events and processes. Sediments and soils act as archives for the lasting impact of these processes. Archaeological landscape research therefore necessitates a diachronic approach as well as a focus on the sediment archive as the bulk study material.\nAn effort towards studying and reconstructing landscape life histories is currently being undertaken by the “Life of a Landscape” project in the Kreuttal microregion in Lower Austria. We target the sediment archive as our main research material for identifying anthropogenic and natural formation processes, evidence of human-landscape interactions, and the chronostratigraphic landscape context. The project goal is the creation of an archaeological landscape biography to trace the development of the Kreuttal landscape over the millennia and identify the main formation processes involved in landscape and land use changes. To this end we employ an interdisciplinary methodological approach that combines landscape- and geoarchaeological methods and techniques, including geophysical prospection and remote sensing, coring, sedimentology, stratigraphy, geochemistry, OSL dating, and historic landscape characterisation.\nThis presentation will explore how results from these efforts help identify anthropogenic and natural activities, features and processes and facilitate insights into the research area’s geomorphology, topographic changes, chronostratigraphic sequences, and space and land use. Preliminary results offer new insights into a highly dynamic landscape history and underline the potential of interdisciplinary, holistic approaches in archaeological landscape research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 17th – Barbara Huber (University of Bonn, Germany)\n\n\n\n\n\nTime: 12:00 pm (UTC)\nTitle: Tracing ancient practices through archaeo-metabolomics: a new window into the sensory and medicinal landscapes of the past\nKeywords: Archaeometabolomics; Biomolecular archaeology; Ancient medicine; Past scents\nAbstract: Aromatic plants, herbs, and resins have long shaped human experiences—serving not only as olfactory markers in ritual and spiritual life but also as potent agents in healing, hygiene, and medicine. In ancient societies, the lines between incense, remedy, and ritual were often blurred, especially in regions like Arabia where aromatic substances held multifaceted roles in both daily routines and ceremonial practices.\nThis talk introduces archaeo-metabolomics, the study of small molecules (metabolites), as a powerful new lens for exploring the biochemical fingerprints of ancient plant-based practices. Moving beyond traditional text-based and typological approaches, metabolomics applies high-resolution metabolite profiling to archaeological materials, such as ceramic residues and soils – to detect a broad range of metabolites, including alkaloids, terpenes, and flavonoids. These molecular traces enable the reconstruction of complex human-plant interactions, from therapeutic formulations to incense practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 1st – Meilin Lyu (University of Athens, Greece)\n\n\n\n\n\nTime: 1:00 pm (UTC)\nTitle: Accelerated thermal and freeze-thaw cycling effects on the durability of Greek marble in built heritage\nKeywords: Climate change factors; Marble; Built heritage; Deterioration; Greece\nAbstract: The durability of marble heritage structures is increasingly threatened by climate change-induced temperature fluctuations and moisture variability. This study examines the impact of two key weathering processes—thermal cycling and freeze-thaw (FT) cycling—on three types of Greek marble commonly used in built heritage. The primary aim is to assess the extent of structural deterioration caused by repeated heating, cooling, freezing, and thawing, simulating real-world climatic stresses. This study aimed to study both the surface and interior deterioration of Greek marble. The changes were assessed in terms of sub-surface structural alterations analyzed using state-of-the-art techniques such as ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) and x-ray computed tomography; surface observations were conducted using digital microscopy and SEM, while the strength properties of Greek marbles were evaluated using compressive strength testing. Additionally, chemical minerals in Naxos marble inclusions were investigated using handheld XRF. The study highlights the differential impact of thermal and moisture-related stresses on marble deterioration, emphasizing the anisotropic behavior of different marble types. These results have significant implications for conservation strategies, underscoring the need for protective treatments such as water repellents and microclimate stabilization to mitigate both thermal and moisture-induced damage. By integrating controlled laboratory simulations with environmental stressors, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the long-term resilience of marble heritage under evolving climatic conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 16th – Ilia Kovalev (The Cyprus Institute, Cyprus)\n\n\n\n\n\nTime: 12:00 pm (UTC)\nTitle: Egyptian blue production: a diachronic perspective\nKeywords: Egyptian blue; Ancient materials; Ancient technology; High-temperature processes; Technical ceramics\nAbstract: Egyptian blue is the earliest known artificially produced inorganic pigment, which from its first appearance in Early Bronze Age Egypt remained an intrinsic part of the artistic palette over several millennia. The application of Egyptian blue was not limited to being used as a pigment only, as it also served as a raw material for the production of small objects like beads, scarabs, and figurines. From the material science standpoint, Egyptian blue is a multi-phase material comprising crystals of cuprorivaite (CaCuSi4O10) embedded in an amorphous glass phase along with possible remains of partially reacted raw materials. While the chemical and physical properties of Egyptian blue are fairly well understood, our grasp on the broader context of its production remains limited. Being a high-temperature process, the production of Egyptian blue necessitates the use of crucibles. The present talk will focus on Egyptian blue crucibles from LBA Qantir, Iron Age Kom Tuman, and Hellenistic/Roman Kom Helul in an attempt to highlight the diachronic change in Egyptian blue production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 29th – Aitor Brito Mayor (University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain)\n\n\n\n\n\nTime: 2:00 pm (UTC)\nTitle: Zooarchaeology and isotopic evidence for subsistence in Fuerteventura: the animals of the Majos (Canary Islands)\nKeywords: Zooarchaeology; Stable isotopes; Arid; Island; Diet\nAbstract: Preliminary isotopic analyses of human remains from Fuerteventura suggest a notable reliance on marine resources, raising questions about previously proposed models of subsistence. To address this, we conducted zooarchaeological and preliminary isotopic analyses (δ13C and δ15N) on faunal assemblages from three archaeological sites on the island. Our study aimed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the dietary strategies employed by the Majos and the role of environmental constraints in shaping subsistence practices.\nThe zooarchaeological evidence reveals a diverse spectrum of exploited fauna, including domestic animals, wild terrestrial species, and marine resources, suggesting a more diversified subsistence strategy than previously assumed. Isotopic analyses of terrestrial faunal remains display unusually high nitrogen values and positive carbon signatures, likely reflecting the arid conditions of Fuerteventura and the absence of significant mountainous regions, which influence local isotopic baselines. This research highlights the need to integrate human and faunal remains in isotopic studies to elucidate the complex interaction between environmental factors, subsistence strategies, and isotopic signatures in archaeological contexts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 14th – Mette Langbroek (Leiden University & SAGA Archeologie, The Netherlands)\n\n\n\n\n\nTime: 10.00 am (UTC)\nTitle: Worlds on a string. On beads and exchange in Merovingian northern Gaul\nKeywords: Beads; Exchange; Early Middle Ages; Merovingian period; Grave goods\nAbstract: Mette Langbroek is a PhD researcher at Leiden University and works as a materials specialist and researcher at SAGA Archaeology. She studied Historical Archaeology at Leiden University (2016, cum laude) and specializes in early medieval exchange networks, Merovingian and Carolingian beads, combining chemical analyses of these beads with new ways of thinking about Merovingian archaeology. In addition to her research work, she works as a materials specialist and object photographer at SAGA Archaeology and was a guest curator at the National Museum of Antiquities on the exhibition 5000 Years of Beads. In this lecture, Mette will discuss her research on exchange in the early Middle Ages, using beads that were frequently placed in graves with the deceased during this period. Surprisingly, these beads were often imported over vast distances. The rural population of Northern Gaul during the Merovingian period thus had access to trade networks that stretched from England to far into Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember – Petra Tušlová (Charles University, Czech Republic & British School at Athens, Greece)\n\n\n\n\n\nDate, title and abstract will be announced soon."

Indeed, in Taiwan and the Philippines, there is no mention of a Bronze and Iron Age but of a Metal Age (or directly an Iron Age) since iron, copper-based, glass and precious metal technologies seem to appear together in archaeological context. The first signs of metallurgy in the island contexts of Taiwan and the Philippines appear to have followed similar patterns; no Bronze Age, no sign of primary production, only secondary production and where maritime exchange is a central issue in the development of these technologies. Metallurgy would probably have reached the islands through maritime contacts with mainland Southeast Asia, where metallurgical practices took place earlier (11-13th BC) and maritime contacts have been known since the Neolithic period, notably through nephrite objects. Current evidence seems to support that Taiwan and the Philippines did not have any primary production of copper during the Metal Age but still needs to be proved by future studies. It has been proposed that raw materials and some finish objects were imported. However, secondary production activities are attested with molds, both in Taiwan and the Philippines.\nCopper and its alloys are one of the materials thought to come from the maritime interactions and thus represent an important proxy to study the movements of goods/communities/technologies between the different areas around the South China Sea. Regarding the similarities observed between Taiwan and the Philippines as well as the ancient exchanges attested between the two areas, the current project aims to collect data in order to start discussing the copper-based traditions and the potential exchange networks. We also hope that the data can contribute to understand the origin, timing and development of copper-based metallurgy in Taiwan and the Philippines and its link to other regions for the acquisition of raw materials/finish objects. Around 50 scientific samples, mainly in Taiwan so far, have been collected to be studied following an archaeometric approach (Optical Microscopy, SEM-EDS and ongoing lead isotope analyses). In Taiwan, the current results show that artefacts are diverse, both in terms of their forms (such as bells, vessels, knife handles, Chinese coins, unidentified fragments) and composition (alloys), including bronze, leaded-bronze, high-tin bronze, unalloyed copper, leaded copper and brass. Some artefacts result probably from oversea exports. In Taiwan, differences can also be observed between sites, probably as a result of the different metallurgical practices identified during the excavations, such as secondary production activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 1st – Alkiviadis Sideridis (University of Athens, Greece)\n\n\n\n\n\nTime: 8:00 am (UTC)\nTitle: Tinos’ lost ancient serpentinite quarry (Cyclades, Greece): an interdisciplinary approach\nKeywords: Stone analysis; Serpentinite; Cyclades Greece; Ancient quarry\nAbstract: The study of marble and coloured-stone production centres of antiquity carries a significant role in the scientific community, being a subject where natural and archaeological sciences may interweave, aiming to decipher quarrying methods, trade and the unique geological fingerprint of the stones. Contemporary quarrying activity on Tinos Island, Greece, is focused on ophicalcites (metasomatic rock consisting of serpentine and carbonates), however, the studied ancient quarry of Ag. Georgios Ras (Ras serpentinite) consist of a distinctive serpentinite, with no carbonate participation when compared to the neighbouring ophicalcite. Ras serpentinite was quarried from two small-scale open pits demonstrating tool marks, grooves, as well as holes for inserting wedges. The serpentinite consists of, macroscopically and mineralogically, two serpentine varieties, a dark green demonstrating massive texture and a light green forming a network of fibrous serpentine. Research efforts on serpentinite provenance are limited and lack information and data when compared to the study of white marble. This study aims to enrich the present database using a variety of techniques, including XRD, LA-ICP-MS and physicomechanical tests to determine the geochemistry, geotectonic environment of formation and strength characteristics of the Ras serpentinite. The geological study is framed, in an interdisciplinary approach, by archaeological and lichenometrical data and observation to further shed light upon the newly explored Ras serpentinite quarry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 10th – Thorsten Jakobitsch (Austrian Archaeological Institute, Austria)\n\n\n\n\n\nTime: 8:00 am (UTC)\nTitle: Plant and insect remains as indicators for waterlogged dung layers – The example of the Neolithic lakeshore settlement Mooswinkel in the Austrian Alps\nKeywords: Stable manure; Pile dwelling; Archaeobotany; Archaeoentomology; Late Neolithic\nAbstract: Stable manure preserves well in waterlogged archaeological sediments. The organic refuse provides a wealth of information about the site’s economy, forest resources, and impact on the environment. However, the recognition of middens and manure in sediment layers is not always straightforward. In the case study of the Late Neolithic pile dwelling Mooswinkel at the lake Mondsee in Austria, dung, botanical macro- and microremains, as well as invertebrates identified the sediment as stable manure from goat, sheep and cattle farming. Furthermore, the season of the layer formation could be recognized. Materials investigated included pollen, bryophytes, plant fruits and seeds, leaves, branches and bud scales of woody plants, as well as insect remains. In addition, plant microremains in dung were analysed. The results of this multi-material study show that leaf hay and grass hay were used as fodder during the winter season. The impact of fodder acquisition and pasturing on the forest could be reconstructed, showing the formation of a mosaic landscape of natural and semi-natural habitats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 10th – Madison McCartin (University of California, Davis, USA)\n\n\n\n\n\nTime: 2:00 pm (UTC)\nTitle: Biomolecular insights into Magdalenian ungulates from Petersfels (Hegau Jura, southwestern Germany) via ZooMS and stable isotope analysis\nKeywords: Magdalenian; ZooMS; Stable isotopes; Zooarchaeology; Paleoenvironment; Ungulates\nAbstract: After the Last Glacial Maximum, ameliorating climates facilitated the recolonization of Central Europe by human and animal groups. Petersfels, situated in the Hegau Jura of southwestern Germany, evidences the later stages of this repopulation, dating to ~16-14 ka cal BP. Over the past hundred years, numerous excavations at the site have revealed an exceptional record of Magdalenian subsistence including abundant lithic and osseous material, personal ornaments, engravings, and female figurines. Faunal remains are particularly relevant, as they archive information on human and animal lifeways as well as the broader post-LGM environmental context. However, despite this great potential, little is known about the paleoecological context of the site or the broader Hegau Jura. Here, we present new biomolecular analyses of the Petersfels faunal assemblage, which help to illuminate the paleoecology of the region. Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS) was applied to identify rare taxa and to differentiate between closely related species. We also conducted stable isotope analyses of carbon (δ13C) and oxygen (δ18O) from serially sampled equid and bovid tooth enamel carbonate. The latter contributes to our understanding of local paleoecology during the Magdalenian and the status of human and animal communities during post-LGM climatic change. More broadly, this work shows how heritage collections like Petersfels are still immensely valuable, especially with the application of modern biomolecular techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 11th– Veronica Occari (University College London, UK)\n\n\n\n\n\nTime: 12:00 pm (UTC)\nTitle: The technology of polychrome glazed ceramics in Ifriqiya: new data from the Medjerda Valley\nCo-authors: H. Möller, C. Fenwick, P. Quinn, I.C. Freestone, M. Chaouali, P. von Rummel\nKeywords: Ifriqiya; Medieval glazed ceramics; Pottery technology; Petrography; Compositional analyses\nAbstract: Ifriqiya (roughly Tunisia and eastern Algeria) is believed to have played a significant role in the diffusion of ceramic glazed technologies into other regions of the Western Mediterranean. However, due to limited analysis on North African glazed ceramics, its role in technology transfer remains poorly understood. This paper uses petrographic, SEM-EDS and LA-ICP-MS analyses to understand the technology employed in the production of Tunisian ceramics through the study of polychrome glazed ceramics from medieval settlements at the sites of Chimtou (ancient Simitthus) and Bulla Regia, Tunisia, dated to the late ninth-twelfth century. The results provide new insights on workshops practices, on the origin of the ceramics and on regional inland exchange networks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 10th – Sibylle Manya (National Centre for Research and Restoration in French Museums, France)\n\n\n\n\n\nTime: 3:00 pm (UTC)\nTitle: Chrysocolla at high temperatures: understanding Pre-Hispanic metallurgy through Collahuasi slag analysis (Tarapaca, Chile)\nCo-authors: B. Mille, V. Figueroa Larre, T. Bataille, L. Le Pollès, J.-B. d’Espinose de Lacaillerie\nKeywords: Chrysocolla characterization; Thermal analysis; Pre-Hispanic copper metallurgy\nAbstract: Ujina-Collahuasi is an archaeological site located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, renowned as a major center for copper production during the pre-Inca and Inca periods. Pre-Hispanic metallurgists utilized bench-shaped granodiorite furnaces to smelt ore, leveraging the wind to achieve high temperatures and extract copper in the form of metallic beads. The resulting slag, rich in silicon, exhibits various mineralogical phases, notably yellow-green or yellow-orange phases that are of particular interest. These phases, rich in copper and silicon, may be attributed to the prevalence of chrysocolla among the ores used.\nThis study focuses on a characterization of chrysocolla, a copper silicate with an amorphous and controversial structure. At ambient temperature, several analytical techniques (PIXE, SEM-EDS, and solid-state NMR) were employed to overcome challenges related to its variable chemical composition and disordered crystalline structure. At high temperatures, the thermal decomposition of chrysocolla was investigated by heating several samples to different temperatures and characterizing them using various techniques (optical microscopy, XRD, IR spectroscopy, SEM-EDS). Additionally, an in-situ study was conducted, providing XRD scans of a sample subjected to increasing temperatures.\nThe results obtained enhance our understanding of the transformation of chrysocolla observed in the pre-Hispanic slag from Collahuasi and the evolution of metallurgical techniques. Previous studies have been supplemented by analyzing slags from excavations in the Ujina 10 sector, including three furnaces dated to different periods. The objective was to identify any changes in copper reduction techniques between the pre-Inca and the Inca occupation."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA seminar series in July 2025.\nThe durability of marble heritage structures is increasingly threatened by climate change-induced temperature fluctuations and moisture variability. This study examines the impact of two key weathering processes—thermal cycling and freeze-thaw (FT) cycling—on three types of Greek marble commonly used in built heritage. The primary aim is to assess the extent of structural deterioration caused by repeated heating, cooling, freezing, and thawing, simulating real-world climatic stresses. This study aimed to study both the surface and interior deterioration of Greek marble. The changes were assessed in terms of sub-surface structural alterations analyzed using state-of-the-art techniques such as ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) and x-ray computed tomography; surface observations were conducted using digital microscopy and SEM, while the strength properties of Greek marbles were evaluated using compressive strength testing. Additionally, chemical minerals in Naxos marble inclusions were investigated using handheld XRF. The study highlights the differential impact of thermal and moisture-related stresses on marble deterioration, emphasizing the anisotropic behavior of different marble types. These results have significant implications for conservation strategies, underscoring the need for protective treatments such as water repellents and microclimate stabilization to mitigate both thermal and moisture-induced damage. By integrating controlled laboratory simulations with environmental stressors, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the long-term resilience of marble heritage under evolving climatic conditions.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "title": "Of landscape biographies and sediment archives: reconstructing the landscape history of the Kreuttal microregion in Lower Austria",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA seminar series in May 2025.\nJust like people or physical objects, landscapes have life histories that are shaped by past events and processes. Sediments and soils act as archives for the lasting impact of these processes. Archaeological landscape research therefore necessitates a diachronic approach as well as a focus on the sediment archive as the bulk study material.\nAn effort towards studying and reconstructing landscape life histories is currently being undertaken by the “Life of a Landscape” project in the Kreuttal microregion in Lower Austria. We target the sediment archive as our main research material for identifying anthropogenic and natural formation processes, evidence of human-landscape interactions, and the chronostratigraphic landscape context. The project goal is the creation of an archaeological landscape biography to trace the development of the Kreuttal landscape over the millennia and identify the main formation processes involved in landscape and land use changes. To this end we employ an interdisciplinary methodological approach that combines landscape- and geoarchaeological methods and techniques, including geophysical prospection and remote sensing, coring, sedimentology, stratigraphy, geochemistry, OSL dating, and historic landscape characterisation.\nThis presentation will explore how results from these efforts help identify anthropogenic and natural activities, features and processes and facilitate insights into the research area’s geomorphology, topographic changes, chronostratigraphic sequences, and space and land use. Preliminary results offer new insights into a highly dynamic landscape history and underline the potential of interdisciplinary, holistic approaches in archaeological landscape research.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA seminar series in April 2025.\nFrom 1500 BC onward, the increasing number of casting moulds, copper ingots, and hoards attests to a significant rise in metallurgical activity in the Western and Central Balkans. However, while Copper and Early Bronze Age metal production in the region has been extensively studied, the metallurgical practices of the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age have received far less attention.\nThis presentation will explore the elemental composition of Bronze Age copper-based objects from various archaeological contexts and discuss what these findings reveal about alloying practices, as one of the final stages in the metallurgical chaîne opératoire. Rather than focusing solely on raw material provenance, this study aims to reconstruct technological choices in metalworking practices and adaptations in local bronze production.\nThe goal of this study is to contextualize newly generated trace and minor element data (ED-XRF) within broader archaeological and chronological frameworks. Rather than focusing solely on raw material provenance, the emphasis lies on understanding deliberate technological choices in metallurgical practices, and adaptation in local bronze production. By integrating chemical data with cultural-historical perspectives, this research offers new insights into prehistoric metal production in the region.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA seminar series in January 2025.\nBordered by the Aegean and central Anatolia, the prehistory of western Anatolia has remained relatively unexplored. This is particularly the case for the rural economy, despite its evident importance to cultural developments within neighbouring regions. A small but growing body of scholarship is beginning to rectify this through bioarchaeological research aimed at reconstructing systems of farming and land use in the past. Focusing on the Aegean region of western Anatolia, I outline how these studies have transformed our understanding of agrarian lifeways and can shed new light on the dramatic cultural developments that can be traced across the Neolithic and Bronze Age. I go on to assess the implications of this regional trajectory for broader developments across the Aegean.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nThe polychrome decoration of fine metalwork objects, particularly the use of red garnet inlays, was widespread during the Hellenistic, Roman and Early Medieval times, representing an intercultural and supra-regional fashion in Europe. In the archaeological material of the Carpathian Basin this polychromy was characteristic over around three centuries, from the Hunnic Period through the age of the Gepidic and Langobardic Kingdoms up until the Avar Period. While 5th century artworks tend to be unique, artefacts from the subsequent decades exhibit closer resemblances to mass-produced items characterised by many common features. During the first two-thirds of the 6th century, the territory of the Carpathian Basin was ruled by two Germanic tribes with different origins and histories: the Gepids settled in the Tisza region and the Langobards in Transdanubia. This study focuses on these two regions, exploring the differences and similarities, as well as the chronological and regional changes in the use of raw materials, metalworking and decoration techniques, and the supply of garnets. Nearly a hundred gold, gilded silver, and copper-based alloy objects from the collections of the Hungarian museums, dated to the late 5th and 6th centuries AD, were analysed in detail by using non-destructive and non-invasive analytical methods (optical microscopy, handheld XRF, SEM-EDX, μ-XRD, Raman spectroscopy) to determine the chemical composition of the metal alloys and their decorations (gilding, niello and garnet), the mineral inclusion characteristics of the garnets, as well as the microstructure and mineralogical composition of the niello.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nIn the summer of 2024, the remains of an Early Copper Age house, destroyed by intentional burning, were excavated at Marosnagylak (Romania). Following the fieldwork, two separate one-week sessions were conducted to undertake intensive post-excavation analysis. Although the processing of the material is still ongoing, preliminary observations and the documentation of a significant number of daub fragments have already yielded valuable insights into the structure of the house, the intensity of the fire, and the dynamics of the collapse. Twenty distinct material types were identified, primarily based on temper composition and the degree of thermal alteration. Spatial distribution analysis of these types provided further data on fire intensity and propagation. Imprint analysis revealed several morphological categories (straight, curved, right-angled); within the curved group, subcategories were established based on diameter, suggesting different architectural components (twigs, stakes, posts). The density and typology of impressions allowed for the partial reconstruction of structural units, including flooring, corner elements, and wall fabrics. The most informative fragments were documented through precise measurements, high-resolution photography, and detailed drawings. Ethnographic and archaeological analogies were also considered in interpreting the architectural elements. Combined analysis of material composition, burning intensity, and spatial patterns suggests a structure that collapsed inward. Continued analysis is expected to provide further insights into the building’s life cycle and the circumstances surrounding its final destruction.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nIn the last decade, new information has been generated in South America on the technology of rock painting production using archaeometric techniques. This has meant an advance in the understanding of the materials and methods embedded in their production and has contributed to generating new questions about human intentionality derive from the visibility of certain physicochemical aspects. In Chile and particularly, recent work in the semi-arid north on the tradition of rock paintings, the application of archaeometric techniques has made it possible to broaden the discussion on the variability of methods of production through the identification and characterization of the raw materials used. Based on this, the present research, used the concept of technological practices, sought to approach methods of production, addressing microscopic and chemical attributes using SEM-EDS microscopy. Founded on experimental archaeology, different pigment mixtures were produced to evaluate the visibility of certain technological practices, such as pigment selection, grinding methods, extenders, and techniques, among others. The main results indicated greater variability based on optical microscopy, while SEM-EDS results tended to homogenize technological practices. Started on these results, we propose a discussion based on the advantages and limitations of archaeometric analysis and additionally the classical concepts used in the technological study of paintings, with the aim of generating a methodological discussion on the study of cave paintings.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nThis study investigates approximately 300 glass beads from the early medieval cemetery of Zweeloo (the Netherlands; ca. 400-900 CE) by combining typological and chemical analysis (pXRF). The aim is to reconstruct exchange networks, trace possible material supply routes, and identify recycling processes, thereby gaining a more complete understanding of all stages in the bead-making sequence. Additionally, this study highlights the benefits of a typochronological approach in which chemical composition analysis is firmly embedded. The chemical composition of the beads from Zweeloo reveals multiple base glass types, reflecting origins in the Mediterranean and Southeast Asia. The chemical data has varied outcomes, points to groups of beads that were produced together and stayed together until they were deposited in the cemetery, while at the same time indicating the reuse and recycling of glass that took place. Typological and compositional data also reveal that beads from different chronological phases co-occur in individual graves, suggesting prolonged circulation of the objects, possibly as heirlooms. By integrating chemical composition with typological and contextual information, this research explores glass bead production and circulation. It also shows how a typochronological approach can help to further define known beadgroups - from raw glass composition to recycling and final deposition. Overall, the beads from Zweeloo demonstrate how archaeometric analysis can illuminate the complexity of early medieval exchange patterns and bead-making traditions across regions.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nThe detection of ergot alkaloids in archaeological contexts opens new avenues for understanding the use of psychoactive or medicinal fungi in the past. Ergot, a parasitic fungus of cereal grains, produces alkaloids with psychoactive, vasoconstrictive, and hallucinogenic properties, which may have played roles in traditional medicine, ritual practices, or accidental poisonings. Inspired by recent archaeological findings from Vilnius Lower Castle, where ergot remnants were identified in wooden structures, this study presents a novel electrochemical sensor based on a riboflavin-derived molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) for alkaloid detection. Ergot alkaloids, extracted from fresh Claviceps purpurea mushrooms collected in local fields, served as templates for MIP imprinting. Riboflavin (vitamin B2), a redox-active and naturally occurring molecule, was electropolymerized to form a conductive film capable of recognizing ergot compounds. Vitamins like riboflavin are promising building blocks for biocompatible sensors due to their inherent redox properties and environmental sustainability. The resulting sensor demonstrates promise for detecting trace compounds in archaeological residues, bridging analytical chemistry and cultural heritage research. This work highlights the potential of vitamin-derived polymers in developing biocompatible and archaeometrically relevant sensing tools.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nThis poster presents the results of a multianalytical archaeometric analysis on ceramic material recovered from the sanctuary of Apollo Pythios in Gortyn, Crete (Greece), dated from the Protogeometric to the Archaic period. The analysis was performed on 46 ceramic sherds, consisting of a petrographic characterization through optical microscopy applied in 17 coarse grained samples, chemical analysis through X-ray fluorescence to identify the major, minor, and trace elements of 20 of the samples; and all the samples were characterized in terms of mineralogical composition through X-ray powder diffraction. The archaeometric data were statistically treated through cluster analysis and principal component analysis, and combined with the material’s typo-chronological and macroscopic evaluation. The results reveal both continuity and transformation in paste preparation and fabric selection, hinting at a preference for typologically-driven ceramic recipes that seem to stay rather consistent throughout the archaeological periods. This work represents the first application of archaeometric methods in archaeological materials from Gortyn, offering valuable insights into local craft traditions and socio-cultural dynamics at a key site in Southern Crete. This study also contributes to broader discussions on material culture, ritual practices, and community formation during the formative centuries of the Cretan polis.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nThe Gumelnitsa culture is one of the most representative expressions of the Eneolithic in the northern Balkan Peninsula, with a range covering vast regions of southern Romania - Muntenia, eastern Oltenia, southeastern Moldavia and Dobrogea - as well as the southern Danubian territories of Bulgarian and Greek Thrace. This extension defines the Gumelnitsa-Kodžadermen-Karanovo VI cultural complex, whose communities evolved between 4600-3900 BC. Among the numerous archaeological sites identified, the tell of Popina-Bordușani (Ialomita county) is characterized by a complex stratigraphy, which reveals a succession of dwellings: from the Getic and Sarmatic to th Neolithic occupation, the latter being the most important and reaching, in places, a thickness of up to 8 meters. On the basis of chronological and cultural analysis, the tell is attributed to the A2 phase of the Gumelnitsa culture, reflecting a period of its maximum development. Among the essential aspects of daily life at that time was the production of pottery, a complex process involving careful selection of raw materials, shaping, decoration and firing in specialized kilns. The petrographic analyses carried out on the pottery from the tell of Popina-Bordușani have provided essential information on manufacturing technologies, the source of raw materials, but also the dynamics of craft traditions. The results of this research indicate the persistence of traditional customs and techniques in the process of making and using ceramic vessels, suggesting a cultural continuity deeply rooted within the local community.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nDuring the excavations carried out between 2021 and 2023 in the surroundings of Babarc in Southwest Transdanubia (Hungary), the Janus Pannonius Museum and the Ásatárs Ltd. uncovered an exceptionally rich Early Avar period cemetery. The parallels of the archaeological material reveal in many cases connections with the Byzantine and Merovingian worlds, while the parallels of more conservative burial practices are mainly known from the Eastern part of Hungary (Transtisza region), where a community from the Eastern European Steppe settled during the period. According to our present knowledge, textile remains related to 24 objects/groups of objects have been recognized from 13 graves in the cemetery, mostly related to elements of the garment. Most of the textiles are woven from z-twist yarns in compact or loose tabby with regular yarn thickness. But tabby woven textiles with various yarn thickness also occur in more graves (SNR 4, SNR 11, SNR 25, SNR 26). In the case of a male grave (SNR 2023/1), the woven pattern or embroidery is also clearly identifiable on the textile remains. In two graves (SNR 73, SNR 94) the corrosion of the iron belt fittings has preserved at least two layers of fabric remains, suggesting that the deceased men were buried in multi-layered or lined clothing.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nThis project is a small petrographic case study of eight ceramic pots used as urns at a burial site in Bellinge Fælled near Odense in Denmark dated to around 300-500 AD (Younger Danish Iron Age). Four pots with ornamentations and four without were chosen to investigate any mineralogical and technological differences between the two groups of ceramics in order to examine whether they could have been produced by different potters in different local areas. The petrographic analysis of the eight pots has shown that there is a difference between the urns with and without ornamentations. The pottery with ornamentations has been carefully produced from similar clay- and temper sources with uniform technology which reflects a specific recipe and technology for this type of pottery. The four studied pots without ornamentations, on the other hand, show variations in the clay- and temper sources and in the production process. These pots could have been produced by different individuals and might have been reused from the household pottery. The eight pots have additionally been analysed with the geochemical analysis ICP-MA/ES to investigate their provenance. This has shown that the ceramics were all produced locally on the island of Funen but with clay from four different clay sources. Based on this, the pottery must have been produced by different potters with extensive knowledge of the materials and resources, who were able to select and use different resources for different types of pots with different purposes.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nAs part of my BA thesis in Archaeology, I conducted a non-destructive investigation of a deserted medieval settlement in Tolna County, Hungary. The research employed a combination of methods, including historical map analysis, archival and archaeological aerial photography, magnetometer surveying, and 3D photogrammetric survey using a drone. My primary tasks included executing some of the surveys, processing and evaluating the archaeological data, and interpreting the results. I also reconstructed the site’s topography using archival cartographic, geological, and geographic sources. The integration of multiple survey techniques allowed for the identification of numerous structural features of the former settlement. Different methods revealed different aspects of the archaeological record, and their combined interpretation provided a more comprehensive picture of the site. All data were processed and analyzed within a geoinformatics (GIS) software environment, which also facilitated the reconstruction of the landscape and the settlement layout. The results revealed the main street, property boundaries, ditches, a gate, and the location of the medieval church complex in Gyánt. In this area, two distinct church structures were identified, although their spatial and chronological relationship remains uncertain. In the riverside zone, the remains of a workshop and several mills were inferred. These were supported by environmental reconstruction, written sources, and the earlier discovery of millstone fragments, indicating their proximity to the river. This research highlights the effectiveness of integrating non-destructive methods and GIS analysis in the archaeological study of deserted medieval settlements.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nTurkmenistan, a Central Asian country, remains a relatively understudied region in terms of archaeological research. This study aims to provide an overview of all prehistoric archaeological sites discovered in the region, from the first excavations in the early 20th century to 2023. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to compile an inventory of prehistoric sites and approximate their geographic coordinates. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were further exploited to elaborate spatial distribution maps and analyze site patterns across time periods. A total of 103 sites were recorded, with more than half belonging to the Neolithic, Chalcolithic, and Bronze Age settlements in the southern region of the country. Another significant cluster of Bronze Age and Iron Age sites was recorded in the Murgap alluvial fan area in southeast Turkmenistan, indicating that these two regions have received the most extensive archaeological attention. The oldest known sites, dating back to the late Upper Paleolithic period, are located in the western Balkan region. While the western region has been studied to some extent, the northern region remains largely underexplored. The resulting maps and period-based classifications offer a foundational resource for future archaeological research and emphasize the need for more systematic investigation across less-studied regions of Turkmenistan.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nTwo blue and white glazed ceramic fragments featuring leaf motifs and lustre decoration were recovered during archaeological excavations in Budapest and Győr (Hungary). Comparative research into published majolica finds from the territory of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary revealed a vessel in the collection of the Museum of Applied Arts bearing identical decorative patterns. Based on typological and stylistic analysis, the fragments were dated to the first half of the 15th century and attributed to the renowned majolica workshops of Manises and Paterna (Valencia, Spain). In the last decades, several studies have addressed the archaeometric characterization of raw materials and production technologies employed in these workshops. The results indicate that the ceramic bodies and glaze pigments were made from different raw materials in the different periods of these long-lived workshops. Our aim was to determine if the Hungarian finds were indeed made in these workshops or in another, which imitated their decorative style. Due to the uniqueness of these fragments, destructive analysis was limited to a single sample, while the others were examined using only non-invasive techniques (SEM-EDS and mXRF). Preliminary results indicate that the ceramic bodies were produced using calcareous raw materials, consistent with those used in Valencian manufacture. However, notable differences were observed in the glaze compositions. The laboratory analyses were funded by the Ministry of Innovation and Technology (TKP 2021-NKTA-15).\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nThis presentation will focus on my doctoral project, which I completed in 2025, although it has not yet been published. Within that project, I examined a large archaeological survey ceramic complex from the middle Euphrates region of Syria. The aim of the project was to analyze this material using a multi-analytical approach, with portable energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence analysis (p-ED-XRF) playing a central role. The study investigates whether p-ED-XRF provides sufficiently accurate data to reconstruct ceramic production and distribution in early societies and what complementary methods might need to be employed. I first evaluated the p-ED-XRF in comparison to the conventional method of WD-XRF. The relatively disappointing results show that a combination of selected scientific analyses with both macroscopic and microscopic analysis of technological features is necessary to reconstruct the stages of an individual object’s biography and, in aggregate, the economic processes of the region, which should be demonstrated using a chronologically narrower sample. Finally, based on information generated through the selected methodology for 227 ceramic fragments from the 5th and 4th millennium BCE, differences in manufacturing techniques, raw material use, and style over different periods were examined. The focus was on the development of technologies and their influence on the region’s economic structures. It is found that ceramic production was predominantly local, and specialized household industries developed. The project show, that only the combination of multiple methods allows a comprehensive analysis of ceramic production and distribution in that archaeological research region.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

The study aims to define which features of these vessels resulted from intentional technological decisions and which were influenced by local conditions, such as raw material availability or workshop organization.\nThe research is based on 30 ceramic fragments from both public and private spaces, dated between the 4th century BCE and the 7th century CE, excavated by the Polish Archaeological Mission at Maloutena and Agora. The samples were subjected to petrographic analysis and compared with other ceramic categories from the site, as well as from selected Cypriot sites exhibiting similar economic transformations.\nContrary to expectations of diverse clay usage, the research reveals a strong tendency among potters to rely on a single clay source, even when alternatives were available. However, variability was noted in the selection of tempering material used to modify the properties of the raw material. The evidence suggests a higher degree of specialization during the Roman period, and, alongside increased external influence on production techniques.\nRather than constructing rigid typologies, this presentation seeks to explore ancient society through its material culture. By examining storage vessels, it aims to uncover cultural patterns and technological practices not easily accessible through other types of archaeological evidence. The findings highlight how these vessels reflect broader socio-economic and technological transformations in the ancient Mediterranean world.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nDuring the Middle Bronze Age (2000/1900–1600/1500 BC), different “tell-building” communities can be distinguished in Central and Eastern Hungary, such as the Vatya, Hatvan, Füzesabony and Maros groups. These groups were separated on the basis of different pottery style and burial rite, but their common characteristic is that they lived in tell settlements. This lifestyle required long-term habitation, so the settlements were usually occupied for several hundred years, sometimes by people of different culture groups. In Northeastern Hungary at the Borsod plain region, the Late Hatvan and the Füzesabony groups appeared in this period. These groups can be distinguished by distinct burial rite and pottery style, although their vessels can often be found in the same settlement or cemetery. Within their ceramic assemblages they used different, characteristic vessel shapes and decorations. Therefore, three Middle Bronze Age sites were analysed in this research, Bogács-Pazsagpuszta a Late Hatvan/Füzesabony tell-like settlement, its eastern neighbour Novaj-Földvár, a Füzesabony tell settlement and Vatta-Telek-oldal-dűlő a Füzesabony/Late Hatvan cemetery. Our aim was to detect and compare the raw materials, tempers and firing techniques of Late Hatvan and Füzesabony style ceramics, using thin section petrography, x-ray powder diffraction and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The goal of this research was to detect technological differences or similarities within the two distinct pottery styles, and the raw material analysis of a specific Late Hatvan type fine ware.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nUnderstanding the function of Copper Age pottery requires a complex approach, beginning with the study of size and form, which can determine the range of possible uses of pots. When complemented by organic residue analysis, which provides crucial information about the past contents of individual pots, these possibilities can be narrowed down. Combined with morphometric analysis, this allows for inferences about food processing methods to be made. The type and frequency of certain commodities can also indicate a broader picture of the economy and subsistence strategies. In Transdanubia and the Budapest area, daily life within settlements remains a relatively unknown aspect of Copper Age communities. This includes the function(s) of known pottery forms, culinary practices and the importance of livestock husbandry, especially regarding the use of secondary animal products. To gain insight into these topics, the results of morphometric and organic residue analyses from Early and Middle Copper Age (4500-3800/3700 BCE) settlements in the Budapest area are presented. Based on the results, there was no clear correlation between the form and the type of content. It was confirmed that pottery was mainly used for processing ruminant and non-ruminant products in the Early Copper Age, and dairy processing became common only at the end of the Middle Copper Age.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

The paintings received little attention until recent excavations at nearby Tall Zira’a revealed a new corpus of paintings executed identically. Most fragments, corresponding to the so-called “Masonry Style”, exhibit an impressed stone decoration in yellow and red with a painting technique previously undocumented. The striking similarity suggests they were the work of the same craftspeople. In this context, the composition of plasters, aggregates and pigments offers invaluable insights into the logistics and production processes of painted decorations made by local workshops. In collaboration with the German Protestant Institute of Archaeology in Amman and the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands, twenty-three fragments were shipped to Amsterdam for a multi-method analytical study. The techniques included μXRF, pXRF, XRD, FTIR, SEM-EDS with cross-sections and photo-induced luminescence (VIL, UV, IR). The results revealed the use of several kinds of red ochre and application techniques within the same wall, but not between the stone imitation fragments of both sites. This suggests painters may have worked independently across the same region, with a trusted supply of raw materials, and developed projects in collaboration with other craftspeople.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

The site was identified in 2016 during field investigations for the installation of a gas pipeline and a gas collection and purification station. Archaeological excavations carried out in the same year identified a settlement and a necropolis dating back to the Late Neolithic period, the Herpály culture. Research at the settlement continued in 2021. The Neolithic settlement at Moftinu Mare is remarkable for its rich ceramic material, lithic materials and animal bones. The archaeozoological material studied comes from the settlement, and was excavated during the campaigns of 2016 and 2021. Primary archaeozoological analysis showed a predominance of domestic species, especially cattle (Bos taurus). Other animals identified in the settlement are domestic pigs (Sus domesticus), sheep/goats (Ovis/Capra) and canids (Canis familiaris). Hunting represented a less important occupation of the Moftinu Mare community; among the wild animals present at the site we find red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus caprelous), aurochs (Bos primigenius) and bison (Bison bison). Archaeozoological investigations have identified several traces of disarticulation (cut marks) and gnawing on the distal epiphyses of cattle bones. The processing of deer and roe deer antlers was also attested in the settlement. Bone pathology was observed on one of the bovine metacarpals.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nGrave reopenings in the 6th-century Langobard-period cemetery of Gyirmót–Homokdomb, located in Northern Transdanubia, offer a valuable opportunity to explore post-burial interactions with the dead during the Migration Period. This study applies archaeothanatological and bioarchaeological approaches and methods to examine selected burials showing evidence of disturbance. The analysis focuses on the stratigraphic and spatial characteristics of selected/ these reopened graves, including alterations in skeletal positions, and the possible removal of bones and grave goods. Particular attention is given to identifying patterns of disturbance and assessing their consistency across multiple features. Preliminary bioanthropological observations aim to detect indicators of post-depositional manipulation, such as the rearrangement of skeletal elements or damage not attributable to natural taphonomic processes. Material culture associated with disturbed contexts is also examined for evidence of fragmentation, redeposition, or spatial reorganization. Rather than assuming a single motivation behind these reopenings, this study explores a range of possible explanations—ritual, social, or practical—within the broader framework of Langobard mortuary customs. The ongoing analysis seeks to refine our understanding of the role of reopened graves in the funerary landscape and the significance of post-burial practices during this transitional period.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nWhile the study of childhood in the past has gained considerable momentum in recent decades, both from social archaeological and bioanthropological perspectives, it remains largely unexplored within Icelandic biological anthropology. To date, I am the only researcher actively investigating this field. In response to this gap, I conducted the first bioarchaeological study of early life courses at four sites in Northern Iceland dating from the 10th to 13th centuries AD. The results revealed significant growth disruption in infants and high mortality rates between 1.5 and 4.5 postnatal months. These patterns point to poor maternal and infant health and a postnatal decline in immunological and nutritional support, likely shaped by the adverse living conditions that characterized early medieval Northern Iceland. These included a harsh and unstable climate, nutritional deficiencies, poor indoor air quality, and high exposure to infectious diseases within domestic spaces. Building on these findings, my PhD project will further examine childhood health, mortality, and social identity at these four sites. It will incorporate methods such as dimorphic peptide analysis of dental enamel for biological sex estimation in non-adults and stable isotope analysis to reconstruct breastfeeding and weaning practices. In my presentation, I would like to outline the results of my preliminary research alongside the principal aims and hypotheses of my ongoing doctoral project.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nSince its first application to archaeological artefacts almost 60 years ago, the analysis of lead isotopes evolved into the default method for reconstructing the raw material provenance of non-ferrous metals. Pre-requisite is a collection of data with known raw material provenance to compare the artefact data to. Unfortunately, the compilation and re-use of this data is often hampered, among others, by the large variety and different levels of detail of their metadata. TerraLID aims to improve this situation by providing a digital research data infrastructure with a single point of access for the publication, storage, and access of lead isotope data combined with a web application for working with such data and submitting them. An essential part of this research data infrastructure is a metadata profile for the uniform description of the data and their metadata. Development of this metadata profile aims towards its universal applicability, easy extensibility and efficient storage of information. Guided by the input of the TerraLID editors as community representatives, the entire community is currently encouraged to comment on its draft. As part of this community feedback process, this contribution will present the overall structure and takes a closer look on some aspects to spark discussion and encourage feedback from the audience.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nA systematic chemical investigation of ancient and medieval inks from known socio-geographic contexts could enable a non-invasive, indirect dating of manuscripts. This prospect led to the development of a standardised protocol for the in-situ analysis of inks in historical manuscripts, incorporating energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) spectroscopy. Due to the heterogeneous, thin-layered ink-on-support matrix, ED-XRF analyses of inks are limited to semi-quantitative results. Given the wide variety of configurations in ED-XRF spectrometers, concerns persist regarding the comparability of data generated by different devices. This study addresses these concerns by analysing mock-ups with known ink compositions and a historical manuscript sample using five ED-XRF spectrometers. The results reveal significant discrepancies in relative elemental intensities across spectrometers, linked to factors as the anode material, X-ray optics, incident angle, and acquisition mode. These findings underscore the need for detailed metadata, robust calibration routines, and the use of standard reference materials in the ED-XRF analysis of writing materials. The study calls for greater dialogue among heritage scientists to refine analytical protocols for ink analysis, in order to support reproducible and interoperable data across laboratories and ultimately pave the way for a reliable ink database.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA seminar series in October 2024.\nAfter the Last Glacial Maximum, ameliorating climates facilitated the recolonization of Central Europe by human and animal groups. Petersfels, situated in the Hegau Jura of southwestern Germany, evidences the later stages of this repopulation, dating to ~16-14 ka cal BP. Over the past hundred years, numerous excavations at the site have revealed an exceptional record of Magdalenian subsistence including abundant lithic and osseous material, personal ornaments, engravings, and female figurines. Faunal remains are particularly relevant, as they archive information on human and animal lifeways as well as the broader post-LGM environmental context. However, despite this great potential, little is known about the paleoecological context of the site or the broader Hegau Jura. Here, we present new biomolecular analyses of the Petersfels faunal assemblage, which help to illuminate the paleoecology of the region. Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS) was applied to identify rare taxa and to differentiate between closely related species. We also conducted stable isotope analyses of carbon (δ13C) and oxygen (δ18O) from serially sampled equid and bovid tooth enamel carbonate. The latter contributes to our understanding of local paleoecology during the Magdalenian and the status of human and animal communities during post-LGM climatic change. More broadly, this work shows how heritage collections like Petersfels are still immensely valuable, especially with the application of modern biomolecular techniques.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2024 in Nicosia.\nArchaeological prospection in aquatic sites presents unique challenges compared to land surveys. Until recently, most research efforts were focused on adapting instrumentation and processing methods for mapping cultural objects in deep marine environment. However, the implementation of similar methods in ultra-shallow coastal areas poses specific difficulties due to the challenging environmental context. Preserving cultural layers in these areas is crucial due to factors like rising sea levels, coastal erosion and human activity, which may threaten cultural heritage integrity. Thus, the effective documentation of coastal and ultra-shallow sites requires the integration of modified methodological approaches, both in terms of instrumentation and processing algorithms. The sunken city of Ancient Olous, in modern Elounda, Crete, Greece, holds significant archaeological importance, with evidence of inhabitation since the Archaic period. Offshore geophysical prospection utilizing three-dimensional (3-D) Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) successfully mapped a submerged fortress wall and identified potential archaeological targets buried below the seabed. The results highlight the importance of shallow offshore marine geophysics in archaeological research, offering new tools for coastal zone exploration and integration with land sites underscoring at the same time the importance of this evolving field. By addressing challenges unique to coastal areas, such as dynamic underwater conditions and limited visibility, shallow offshore geophysical prospection can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of maritime archaeology. Further development of the methodological flowcharts and integration into archaeological projects, promises to enhance the study and preservation of submerged cultural heritage worldwide.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

The 3D models of the shortlisted sculptures were generated through the software, and measurements were extracted from those models for further iconometric analysis. This approach could provide accuracy to the measurements of the sculptures with minimal to zero margin of error, which subsequently can be extremely significant while analysing the iconometry of the sculptures.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

They come from Chalcolithic period vessels discovered in three settlements from Romania, Bârlălești-Stanția (Vaslui County), Aldeni-Gurguiul Balaurului (Buzău County) and Bălănești-Muchea Mare (Buzău County), all three belonging to the Stoicani-Aldeni cultural aspect. The Stoicani-Aldeni aspect was defined as a “mixed aspect” or “synthesis facies” between the Gumelnița and the Pre-Cucuteni/Cucuteni civilizations, initially on the basis of archaeological excavations at Stoicani-Cetățuia (south-east Romania, Galați County) and Aldeni- Gurguiul Balaurului. This presentation will discuss the results obtained on a batch of Chalcolithic pottery from Eastern and South-East of Romania (ca. 4600-4000 cal BC). Ceramic fragments come from vessels that are typologically different such as bowls, pots, cups, cup, storage vessels and a tray. Following the petrographic analysis, some differences were observed in terms of textural, microstructure, porosity and even compositional characteristics.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2024 in Nicosia.\nThe study assesses the palaeoenvironmental significance of coastal and shallow submarine deposits through the detailed characterisation and absolute dating of beachrock. The physicochemical composition of beachrock deposits provides valuable insights into the sediment types present during beachrock formation over time. The dating technique used was optically stimulated luminescence (OSL). Established analytical techniques, including X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (WD-XRF), and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), were employed for rigorous characterisation of the morphology, as well as qualitative and quantitative mineralogical and elemental composition of the selected samples. Beachrock mapping and sampling were conducted at selected sites along the c.a. 20-km length coastal front of Southeastern Lasithi, Crete, Greece, specifically at Gra Lygia, Ierapetra, Koutsounari, and Ferma sites. The comprehensive characterisation and dating of the samples contributed to refining the chronological context of the beachrock phases in the studied areas (partially presented in previous studies) and facilitated a re-examination of the (micro)environmental conditions, such as the processes involved in beachrock formation and regional trends in past sea level dynamics during the Upper Holocene. Consequently, this first in-depth integrated approach to this area will provide insights into the environmental processes shaping the broader archaeological landscape and illuminate the dynamic interactions between human societies and coastal environments.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2024 in Nicosia.\nIn the Bronze Age (Minoan) palatial site of Malia, Crete, in the so-called “Quartier Mu” of the Protopalatial period (1900-1700 BCE), were found, among particularly rich and varied artefact assemblages, c. 25 vases made of “red serpentinite”. Serpentinite is a metamorphic rock that typically ranges from grey-green to grey-blue, and its red variant, which is much rarer, has not yet been found in natural outcrops in Crete. Because of this, and the fact that its red colour is typically associated with high-temperature metamorphism, it seems that Minoan red serpentinite has not been transformed through natural geological processes but by anthropogenic heating actions. However, the exact conditions of this firing process, as well as whether it was intentional (craftsmanship) or accidental (destruction by fire in Quartier Mu), have not yet been assessed nor demonstrated. This talk aims to address these issues by examining the different potential heating conditions that lead to the modification of the colour of the stone, arguing for an intentional heating process. This will be achieved through laboratory experimental heating supported by geochemical and mineralogical analyses, and by comparisons with the archaeological material. It will additionally provide a preliminary overview of other red serpentinite artifacts found in Minoan Crete. Finally, because Quartier Mu has revealed different types of production linked in part to the elite spheres (metal, pottery and seal production), it will be proposed that the production of red serpentinite at Malia may have emerged thanks to the emulation between the various crafts taking place in the Quarter.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2024 in Nicosia.\nGlass and ceramic artifacts were widely distributed along the trade routes between the East and West during significant periods of trade and cultural exchange, reflecting interactions from manufacturing regions to consuming societies. In the Persian Gulf region, a considerable quantity of ceramic sherds and glass ornaments and vessel fragments have been excavated from coastal town sites in the U.A.E. (14th-16th century CE) and Northern Qatar (18th-20th century CE). Archaeological assemblages indicate that glass bangles were a common accessory during the mid-late Islamic period. Compositional analysis of these representative glass bangles, conducted by LA-ICP-MS and SEM-EDS, revealed several bangles with high alumina content, distinguishing them from the predominant plant ash soda-lime-silica glass of the Islamic period. These unique samples were further classified into two subgroups based on their mineral and plant ash flux compositions. This study aims to identify the possible provenances of these high-Al subgroups relevant to different areas of the Indian Peninsula in terms of major and trace elements of the glasses, and also to illustrate a broad distribution landscape of high-alumina glass spanning South Asia, West Asia, the Levant, and even China. Additionally, the manufacturing techniques of polychrome bangles will be discussed in conjunction with micro-CT analysis results.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2024 in Nicosia.\nIn recent decades, archaeological research in the monumental centre of Rome has revealed a completely new image of the city in Late Antiquity. In particular, the reoccupation of former public spaces for productive activities, among which metalworking seems to have played a prominent role, has been extensively documented. Recent excavations of three metalworking furnaces have yielded a considerable amount of material related to the secondary processing of iron and copper alloys, in particular metal debris and technical ceramics, recorded for the first time in Italy and especially in Rome. The main novelties are two nozzles from bellows at one site and numerous fragments of crucibles from two other sites, which turned out to be kitchenware items repurposed with a refractory lining, revealing an operational pattern for the production of these vessels. All these materials have been subjected to scientific analysis, the results of which, although partial, represent a novelty for the Roman scene and have provided a first, unexpected insight into the alloys and materials used, as well as some of the technological choices made by the metallurgists, showing that the subject merits further study. These studies will allow us to adventure some preliminary answers to archaeologically relevant questions about the economic and social life of Late Antique Rome. This is a very initial approach to larger questions such as the management of resources from a recycling perspective and the potential supply of raw materials.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

The artifacts include three red carved lacquer pieces and one painted lacquer piece, some of which are deteriorating and cracking. Scientific tests will help verify their provenance (China or Japan), as existing literature lacks detailed records. The study combines historical research and materials science to provide comprehensive information for future restoration. Historical research will examine the museum’s collection history and interpret the iconography, hypothesizing possible techniques mentioned in ancient texts. Non-invasive tests using a Digital Microscope, Fiber Optic Reflectance Spectroscopy (FORS), Infrared External Reflection Module, and Raman Spectroscopy will analyze pigments and materials. Micro-samples will be analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), μ-FTIR Spectroscopy, and Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) to identify components, additives, and possibly the origin.

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2024 in Nicosia.\nArgilos was founded on the littoral of the Strymonic Gulf in the mid-7th century BCE. Shortly after its foundation, the city became very prosperous, benefiting from good relations with the local Thracian populations, fertile lands, easy access to various commercial markets, and the abundant wood and metal resources the area has been famous for since Antiquity. Through a Greek-Canadian collaboration, archaeological research carried out in Argilos since 1992 has allowed the discovery of a rich material culture, amongst which are found more than a thousand bronze artifacts. The systematic study of the Argilos’ bronze collection was initiated in 2017 with typological analysis. With limited conclusive results, the scope of the study has been widened by using archaeometric methods, such as metallographic, chemical, and isotopic analyses, carried out on 150 artifacts. With the use of these methods, we seek to contribute to the current state of knowledge on archaic and classical metal production in Northern Greece. Indeed, questions concerning the organization of Argilos bronze production, its integration within its regional context in terms of distribution of primary resources and finished products, and exchange of technological knowledge with other production centers will be addressed. During this presentation, results of the metallographic analysis will be studied. Through the discussion of the latter, we will argue that Argilos’ bronze production was subject to a great degree of standardization, demonstrating a high level of mastery of technical metal processes. In addition, the possibility of a vast distribution network going beyond the region will be explored.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2024 in Nicosia.\nThis paper explores the potential for long-distance knowledge sharing in the production of Majiayao-style pottery in Neolithic Northwest China through macroscopic and microscopic analyses. The paper is divided into two parts. The first part examines the chaîne opératoire of the pottery production process based on tool-trace analysis, petrography, and comparisons with experimentally fired geological samples. The striking consistency and similarities in raw material selection, construction, and firing techniques among pottery from different sites suggest mechanisms for technological knowledge exchange among Neolithic potters. Given that pottery the most abundant or sole evidence for human activity in the region during the Neolithic, the technological perspective presented in this study proves useful in understanding social connectivity and shared knowledge. The second part presents the development of visualization software to enhance the analysis of petrographic photomicrographs in archaeological research. This idea emerged from the methodological challenges faced during the comparative studies of pottery from different sites and geological samples. Traditional thin-section petrography requires laborious visual comparison of individual samples under a microscope. Existing petrography software, primarily designed for geology, lacks features needed for archaeological research, such as multiple sample comparison. The proposed software allows for the simultaneous viewing of multiple photomicrographs, improving the efficiency of analysing ceramic pastes. Developed openly on GitHub with an OSI-approved license, this software aims to be a sustainable tool, fostering collaboration among archaeologists and software engineers, and applicable to any research involving thin-section petrography.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2024 in Nicosia.\nIn our pursuit of characterizing pottery, we are pioneering a novel approach for multi-analytical characterization through µ-LIBS imaging technique (Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy). This cutting-edge methodology facilitates surface analysis spanning a few centimeters, generating an extensive dataset of spectra, upwards of one million and beyond. LIBS offers comprehensive elemental maps with micrometric resolution, crucial for mineral characterization. Supplementing the capabilities of conventional microscopic petrography, our method enables the identification of the granular fraction, known as the temper, on a straightforward polished section of a sherd. Given the substantial volume of data produced across a large surface area, leveraging machine learning for rapid and automated spectrum processing emerges as a potent tool for recognizing mineral families within a sample. These outcomes can subsequently be harnessed to estimate temper characteristics, akin to the capabilities of quantitative microscopy. The resulting maps expedite the examination of temper proportion relative to clay, encompassing both grain size and shape distributions. Notably, in contrast to other elemental techniques providing an overall composition of a sample, such as XRF, the distinctive advantage of µ-LIBS lies in furnishing spatially-resolved spectra across the entire surface. This enables segmentation, allowing the exclusion of temper contributions from the bulk composition of a sherd. Consequently, a quantitative analysis of the clay alone becomes feasible, facilitating comparisons across different potteries irrespective of the added temper, as it is necessary for Lugdunum’s production. This, in turn, holds promise for enhanced identification of raw material sources and hence the provenance of vessels in future investigations.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2024 in Nicosia.\nIn ancient Egyptian culture, shabtis were sets of figurines in the form of mummies made of faience, stone, or wood traditionally deposited inside tombs. According to the Pharaonic funerary beliefs, these figurines acted as magical substitutes for the deceased when the gods called him (or her) to undertake menial tasks in the afterlife. Studying the production process of faience shabtis in addition to their design and engraved inscriptions can provide valuable information. The mineral phase characterization of shabtis kept in museum collections has relied on traditional gemological methods based on visual observations, which are rather inconclusive or too generic and are hindered from the glazed surface of many shabtis. The uniqueness and historical value of these cultural-heritage objects make sampling prohibitive, leading to the growing popularity of non-destructive and non-invasive analytical techniques that are sensitive to both chemistry and crystal structure. Raman spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy and computed tomography (CT) scanning are such non-destructive analytical methods that have been successfully applied for the determination of structure, elemental composition, firing conditions and hidden subsurface structures of painted and enamelled objects. In this study, selected faience shabtis from the collection of the Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg (MKG) were studied by XRF, Raman spectroscopy, and CT Scanning. We show that the combination of these techniques can (i) determine the major, minor, and trace element composition within each mineral phase, (ii) identify the glazing techniques used to produce shabtis, and (iii) reveal structural characteristics of the glaze and subsurface layers.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2024 in Nicosia.\nDelos, located in the Cyclades (Greece), was Rome’s ‘duty free’ hub in the Late Hellenistic period (166/7-89/69 BCE). The central position of the island in Mediterranean trade is reflected in the abundance and variety of ceramic materials recovered during excavations. Among them are braziers–i.e. portable cooking devices. The vast number of braziers found on the island led some scholars to assume that at least some of them were made locally. In order to test this assumption all fragments of braziers unearthed in three temples of Sarapis on Delos were examined macroscopically and 22 samples were analysed with thin section petrography and wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence. The results revealed the presence of six different fabrics, four of which are compatible with the geology of Cycladic islands located in the vicinity of Delos. All of the ‘local’ braziers have the same general morphological characteristics with subtle differences. This ‘Cycladic’ type is stylistically distinct from the ‘imported’ braziers studied, which are more compatible with East Aegean geology.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

Architectural remains representing this period are scarce, but contexts associated with the pre-urban phase as well as Hellenistic and Roman layers yielded ceramic materials of Classical date. This paper focuses on the Classical tableware pottery retrieved from two excavations in Nea Paphos (Maloutena and the Agora) in order to provide more information on the human activity during the period in question. Samples representing various types of bowls and plates were subjected to mineralogical and elemental analyses. The investigations afforded the reconstruction of the chaîne opératoire and consumption patterns of table wares in south-western Cyprus in the Classical period. The comparison of the studied material with already analyzed Hellenistic table ware from Nea Paphos contributes to the exploration of the local potting tradition as well as how it was impacted by socio-economic and political changes.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2024 in Nicosia.\nThe transition of Middle to Late Bronze Age in Cyprus is a significant turning point for the formation and the gradual emergence of more specialized and complex societies. The archaeological research has put emphasis on the study of metallurgy and the long- distance maritime trade for the investigation of the development of this social complexity while aspects such as agricultural intensification and subsistence practices have been neglected. This also could be the result of the limited recovery of archaeobotanical macro- remains from Cypriot Bronze Age sites due to depositional restrictions. This paper aims to contribute on the current research regarding the agricultural practices and the plant exploitation based on the analysis of phytoliths from two sites, Erimi-Laonin tou Porakou and Erimi-Pitharka. Erimi- Laonin tou Porakou is a Middle Bronze Age site consisted of a habitational area, a textile workshop, circular wall and funerary area. On the other hand, Erimi-Pitharka is a Late Bronze Age site, located in close distance south of Erimi-Laonin tou Porakou, includes a building complex related to storage and industrial activities associated to agricultural production. Phytolith analysis reveals a wide range of plant related practices providing comparative data about the agricultural economy at a regional level diachronically.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

The samples were characterized in terms of mineral composition by X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD), petro-fabric by optical microscopy, chemical composition by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and the results were then combined with the typological features (shapes). This diachronic research enabled the identification of a change in the petro-fabric from the Early Bronze Age to the Iron Age, which can be interpreted in terms of modifications in the production recipe, firing, and production techniques of the jars. As the ceramic material here analyzed corresponds to the first in central Syria to be stratigraphically excavated and dated in absolute terms, this provides a significant step into deciphering the history of this important site. This research highlights the possibility of application of archaeometric data to understand the manufacturing techniques and provenance of this ceramic material, while also enabling a reconstruction of circulation patterns of pottery between Bronze and Iron Age Syria.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

Q. 25 (University Library of Leiden) and Cod. in scrin. 145 (State and University Library of Hamburg), are two paper codices, probably produced in Venice in the late 15th century C.E. (ca. 1480-1498). Despite the absence of colophons in the manuscripts, their distinct palaeographical characteristics strongly suggest that they were penned by the hand of Ioannes Rhosos, a renowned professional calligrapher from the Greek island of Crete, who was copying manuscripts for prominent commissioners in Italy during the second half of the 15th century. This paper will a) present the preliminary results of the multi-analytical examination of the black and red inks, that were used by Rhosos in the copying of the two manuscripts and b) provide an initial comparison of the types and compositions of these inks between the two codices. The in-depth analysis and comparison of the inks of the two case studies contribute to the understanding of the types of inks produced and used in the Veneto region by the late 15th century. Equally important, the results obtained in this research constitute a first step towards profiling the working process of a Renaissance important calligrapher in terms of the writing substances he employed. The analysis for this study was performed using non-invasive and non-destructive analytical techniques, such as Ultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) reflectography, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Visible (VIS) spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2024 in Nicosia.\nThe contribution of Environmental studies for understanding the nature of the agrarian economy in the Late Bronze Age Aegean has been widely neglected by previous research. Although archaeobotanical remains were recovered from the first excavations at Aegean sites during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, little attention has been paid to their systematic retrieval and study, since previous research was heavily based on the textual Linear B evidence. Today, although essential research steps have been done, unfortunately, many Aegean archaeologists still consider the archaeobotanical remains as a “second line of evidence”. To contribute to this gap in evidence and to answer basic inquiries on the nature of Mycenaean agrarian economy, systematic archaeobotanical sampling has been applied in Iklaina, in Messenia, Greece. Previous research on the site attests uninterrupted habitation from the LH I to LH III periods. The material that is going to be presented has been retrieved from three individual units, Building NE-A, Building P and Building Z, all of which are dated to the palatial period. Basic inquiries that are at the core of this research are the nature of the agrarian economy at the site (diversified and/or specialized farming) and to distinguish patterns of production before and after the incorporation of Iklaina in the administrative network of Pylos.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2024 in Nicosia.\nThe site of ancient Idalion lies in the centre of the island of Cyprus around 20km southeast of modern-day Nicosia. The site is of vital importance as it is closely situated to the copper mining zone in the eastern foothills of Troodos mountains, and the fertile valley of the Yiallias River. The earliest settlement of the site dates to the 13th to 12th century BCE, while during the excavations conducted by the Department of Antiquities of Cyprus, a Phoenician administrative centre was identified dating to the 4th century BCE. Although, archaeobotanical studies are fundamental in exploring the relationship between communities and the natural environment, bringing forward various characteristics of everyday life in ancient societies, research centring on wood charcoal during the 1st millennium BCE Cyprus have been limited. Thus, this paper seeks to fill this gap by investigating the intricate relations between humans and their natural environment through the application of wood charcoal analysis. This paper also aims to emphasize the key role of archaeobotanical studies in supplementing our understanding of ancient societies by focusing on key aspects such as timber procurement and fuel economy.

The aim is to contribute to the debate of whether a production of domestic pottery took place in the area by studying material found in the actual location. Local production and distribution of such allow for further debate on the social networks and financial role of the city-state of Soli during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. I analysed 50 samples of cooking ware and plain ware pottery by petrography (thin sections) and portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (pXRF), and I included five locally produced amphorae of the Mavrovouni and Skouriotissa types from different locations. Moreover, I had access to previously prepared thin sections of similar types of amphorae found in the Lagoudera area of Troodos as comparable material for my study. Before starting the scientific analyses, I established a preliminary typology based on comparable material and macroscopic descriptions of the fabric. The initial registrations indicated locally produced groups of pottery, which did not compare with pottery found in other locations in and outside Cyprus during the same period.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2024 in Nicosia.\nClay processing can deeply affect the characteristic of a base clay, having important effect on both provenance studies and technological issues in ceramic examinations. Decantation is one of those clay processing techniques that has been used for cleaning the clay from the impurities (coarser fraction) found in the sediment. The influence of this processing is assessed experimentally by delving into the effects it has on a mineralogical, elemental, and microscopic level. Ten clayey materials were sampled from different geographic location in the Mediterranean basin (Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Sudan) to undergo a multianalytical approach before and after they were depurated. X-ray Fluorescence and X-ray Powder Diffraction were used to interpret the mineralogical and chemical changes of the base clay underwent, as well as laser granulometry to establish the changes in terms of grain-size distribution pre and post processing (depuration for sedimentation in calm water). The samples were also fired at 400°C facilitating thin section production enabling microscopic analysis. Digital imaging analysis using the Scanning Electron Microscope with backscattered electron images was crucial for elemental understanding of the clays. Finally, Atterberg limits were measured to explored the impact of decantation on clay plasticity, giving information on changes in mineral type content and organic material. The samples are to be further tested in the close future for isotopic analysis and ICP-MS. By addressing these changes, the study aims to deepen our understanding of clay behavior, therefore helping develop our insights into ceramic production techniques and facilitating provenance studies.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2024 in Nicosia.\nGran Chiriquí, as an archaeological culture area, spans from southern Costa Rica to western Panama and crosses at least three topographic subdivisions – the Pacific Coast, Central Highlands, and the Caribbean Coast – as well as several modern political ones. Of these, the Caribbean Coast is the least studied and has been of little interest archaeologically, primarily in comparison to sites in the Pacific Coast. However, Isla Colón, the largest island in Caribbean Panama, has recently proven unique in the region: the ceramic assemblage from Sitio Drago on Isla Colón’s north shore is more diverse than any known in the region and includes locally-made ceramics, imported wares, and local imitations of exotic styles. To assess the role of Isla Colón in Pre-Columbian trade networks and the ways in which its inhabitants interacted with others in Gran Chiriquí, we performed laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry on archaeological ceramic and clay samples from across Western Panama. The identification of distinct groups based on chemical composition enables us to distinguish possible differences in location of production, or provenance, and thereby establish which ceramic types were being moved and when. This delineation of networks of interaction is based on pottery samples from seven archaeological sites representing three subregions of Gran Chiriquí in the period from AD 1-1500, a period that is traditionally divided into the Aguas Buenas, San Lorenzo, and Chiriquí phases. This collaborative provenance study is pioneering as archaeometric analyses of ceramics have not been undertaken in this area previously.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

Its strategic position and extensive stratigraphic sequence, spanning from the 4th millennium BC to the late Byzantine/medieval period, make it an excellent observatory for studying the numerous changes that have affected southeastern Anatolia and northern Mesopotamia over time. At the YRA 2024 Conference, preliminary results of petrographic analyses conducted using polarized light microscopy on a selection of ceramic artifacts from the Late Chalcolithic 3-5 levels and the Early Bronze Age I (from the early 4th millennium BC to the early 3rd millennium BC) of Zeytinli Bahçe will be presented. The collected data allow us to trace the evolution of craft practices related to the site’s ceramic production, from the origin of raw materials to the manufacturing techniques of the vessels. Through this analysis, it has been possible to identify the persistence of some traditions in the manufacture and use of the vessels, as well as modifications linked to the socio-economic and cultural transformations within the communities that inhabited Zeytinli Bahçe. These data contribute to the debate on the cultural and social transformations that characterized Greater Mesopotamia in the 4th millennium BC, with a particular focus on the northward expansion of Uruk culture groups, aiming to clarify the impact and scope of external cultural influences, such as that of the Uruk culture, on local traditions.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

Archaeological studies have confirmed the presence of iron smelting activities at this site between the 15th and 16th century AD. Eight fragments of tuyères from Pongsolo were analysed by X-ray diffraction and polarised optical microscopy to determine their mineralogy, and deduce their firing temperature and the iron smelting temperature. Five tuyères are reddish with some black parts on their surface, whereas the three others are black and covered with a layer of slag. X-ray diffraction revealed three mineralogical groups of samples: The first group (2 samples) contained quartz, muscovite and kaolinite. The second group (3 samples) contained muscovite and quartz and the third group (3 samples) contained mullite and quartz. The results of polarised optical microscopy agree with the mineralogical groups. The first group is characterised by a reddish matrix with an abundance of mica flakes (biotite and muscovite), indicating a firing temperature range below 600 °C due to the presence of kaolinite. The second group has a dark matrix with few mica flakes, indicating a temperature range of 600 to 900 °C. The third group is characterised by a vitrified matrix, indicating a firing temperature above 1000 °C. The variation of the mineralogy and the firing temperature of the tuyères can be explained by their different position in the furnace. The presence of mullite, vitrification, quartz and a layer of slag in the third group indicated an iron smelting temperature between 1000 and 1300°C.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2024 in Nicosia.\nMetallurgy is always thought to have played a vital role in the development of the Early Bronze Age Aegean societies, being connected to economic development and social complexity. This paper is an overview of the archaeometallurgical study of remains from Early Bronze Age sites located on southern Sifnos, Skali, Kasela and Akrotiraki. The metallurgical remains, lead and copper slag, litharge and furnace wall fragments have been studied using Optical Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). Skali is a copper smelting site, where primary and secondary copper minerals, probably local, were smelted in non-perforated furnaces. At Kasela, the only currently known lead smelting site in the Early Bronze Age Aegean, local argentiferous lead ore was smelted within perforated furnaces. Part of the activities conducted within the settlement of Akrotiraki are related to lead-silver production. The slag from Akrotiraki derives either from smelting of argentiferous lead ore like Kasela, or a refining process of possibly the metal produced at Kasela. The litharge fragments are litharge impregnated hearth linings related to cupellation, whilst silver metal has been detected in some of the samples. Therefore, on southern Sifnos in a radius of approximately 500m the two main stages of the lead-silver production, smelting and cupellation, as well as the primary production of copper are present, rendering it the only area within the Early Bronze Age Aegean that all the above stages of metallurgical production co-exist.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2024 in Nicosia.\nLead isotopes are currently the most powerful method for the reconstruction of the raw material provenance of non-ferrous metals. The success of the method relies crucially on the availability of reference data from all potential ore deposits or other suitable materials with a known production location. OXALID was the first open access database for such data, and many more followed since. While they are great resources, data compilation is still a tedious task because these datasets are usually published in a static format (e.g., as supporting information of articles) and the authors follow their own approaches in the description of the data. The result is datasets that are difficult to combine but to a large extent based on the same pool of publications. To overcome this situation, TerraLID builds upon the prototype GlobaLID but aims to significantly enhance its functionalities towards a digital research data infrastructure that allows the publication, compilation and interpretation of lead isotope data for a large variety of archaeological and geological materials. It aims to implement the FAIR data principles in a community-driven process to ensure that the research infrastructure and metadata are developed close to the needs of the community. The TerraLID team is open, meaning that it welcomes all kinds of contributions from the community and provides many opportunities to get involved in the development process. This contribution will highlight some of these opportunities and presents examples of how this process shaped the design of TerraLID.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2024 in Nicosia.\nWe investigate the chemical refractoriness of high alumina (60-70 wt% Al2O3) crucibles rich in mullite and corundum intended for melting alkali and alkaline earth metal salts. These salts and salt mixtures produce chemically aggressive and low viscosity melts capable of dissolving quartz and crucible walls alike. These interactions are significant for understanding ancient glassmaking processes, as they were used as fluxes to lower the melting temperature of silica, thus being vital components in ancient glass making. The study evaluates the reactivity and interactions of various salts and salt mixtures with an emphasis on their effects on the crucible’s structural integrity and potential seeping through ceramic porosity or even overboiling. Common salts are used to simulate ancient fluxes which were natural mixtures of sodium carbonate and sodium chloride, potassium carbonate, calcium carbonate and sulfate, among others. Various mixtures were tested under controlled laboratory conditions and the results used to outline a detailed protocol for safety precautions necessary when experimenting with these aggressive melts. This study provides a critical assessment on the advantages and disadvantages of using commercially available crucibles and salt raw materials for replicating ancient glassmaking processes. Furthermore, it lays the foundation for the understanding of the reactions between (natural) flux mixtures and the silica source (sand or powdered quartz) during plant-ash glassmaking.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2024 in Nicosia.\nSeveral vascular plants produce silicate, calcium carbonate, and calcium oxalate phases in inorganic components of the plants known as phytoliths (SiO2.nH2O), through biomineralisation. Additionally, smaller amounts of strontium oxalate, strontium sulphate, and barium sulphate phases, among others, have been reported in various plants. Although phytolith analysis is an internationally emerging field, recent studies on phytoliths have not emphasised the extent to which the presence of trace chemical elements affects the dissolution of biogenic silicon and, consequently, the preservation of microscopic phytoliths in geoarchaeological contexts. Toward this end, this project investigates the dissolution behaviour of phytoliths (extracted from fresh wheat cultivated in Greece and Cyprus) in relation to variations of pH, temperature, and time through long-term batch laboratory experiments. Specifically, the mobility of strontium (Sr) and barium (Ba) was studied using ICP-MS, with data processed using MATLAB software. The Sr and Ba displayed almost identical behaviour with a very rapid initial elemental release predominantly within the first five days of the leaching experiment. For the high-resolution characterisation of phytolith morphology, mineralogy, and chemistry, a variety of complementary analytical techniques were employed, including OLM, SEM/EDS, XRD, FTIR, ED-XRF, CHNS and TGA-DTGA. Strontium was detected in some EDS spectra, and strontianite (SrCO3) and/or celestite (SrSO4) were identified in the XRD traces. In this study, Ba-minerals were not identified in the phytoliths; the release of Ba along with Sr during the leaching experiments, suggests that Ba may participate in the crystal lattice of strontium carbonate and/or sulphate mineral, substituting for Sr.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2024 in Nicosia.\nCuneiform represents the earliest form of writing developed by the Sumerians in Mesopotamia in the 2nd half of the 4th millennium BCE. From the middle of the 3rd millennium BCE, people wrote legal documents and sent many letters. To protect the tablets and ensure confidentiality, tablets were encased in clay envelopes. These envelopes featured the names of the sender, the seal imprint using cylinder seals, and the name(s) of the addressee(s). Reading the message required breaking the envelope, however, some letters never reached their recipient and remained within their clay envelopes for thousands of years. The study of enveloped clay tablets serves as an important reminder that unopened heritage artifacts conceal the narratives of their past within both their textual contents and structural integrity. As such, this research aims to explore the application of non-destructive techniques on enveloped clay tablets. In this contribution we present our efforts in developing a portable high-resolution X-ray tomographic scanner, designed in collaboration with the cluster of excellence at Universität Hamburg ‘Understanding Written Artifacts’ and Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron. The X-ray scanner can be assembled and dismantled for use in museums and collections. This newly developed device was recently used for the very first time at the Louvre Museum, yielding excellent tomographic data on twelve contracts and administrative texts from the end of the 3rd and the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE. This innovative system facilitates comprehensive non-destructive measurement of enveloped tablets, covering the entire measurement process from data acquisition to on-site 3D visualization.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2024 in Nicosia.\nSince coins are generally an officially produced medium, provenance studies of the metal used to produce them can provide important information on the logistical, infrastructural and organizational capacities of central authorities. Thus, it is not surprising that ancient coins have been the subject of a large number of archaeometallurgical studies, in particular involving lead isotopes. The composition of the silver in the coin metal of Roman Imperial denarii has been intensively investigated in recent years by Kevin Butcher and Matthew Ponting. However, the work concentrated primarily on the chemical composition, with a relatively smaller number of isotopic analyses being carried out, and concentrating on specific questions. To complement the investigations of Butcher and Ponting, more than 200 coins from the period 30 BC to AD 240 have been sampled for isotopic analysis in a project based at the German Mining Museum in Bochum. Besides standard lead isotopes, these analyses also included copper and silver isotopes, which were performed in Bochum, at the Frankfurt Isotope and Element Research Center FIERCE, the Laboratoire de Géologie de Lyon, École normale supérieure de Lyon, and in the Institute for Geosciences at the Goethe University Frankfurt. The combination of isotopic analyses of different elements has provided deeper, sometimes surprising insights, qualifying the information provided by lead isotopes alone. This paper will present the first results and interpretation of our analyses, so indicating how a combination of isotopic methods can advance our understanding of the provenance and the methods used to obtain the raw materials.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2024 in Nicosia.\nThe goal of this research is to create a comparative catalogue of raw materials and clays from the northern Tuscany region (Italy) used in fine wares, which will serve as a reference database for determining the provenance of archaeological fine wares. Coarse-ware ceramics are generally easier to trace back to their place of origin compared to fine wares, as the latter contain less petrographic information. To address this challenge, a systematic clay sampling campaign was conducted, collecting samples from outcrops near well-known production centers in the north-western Tuscany. This paper presents the clay processing workflow and preliminary results from XRF and XRD analyses of the raw materials. A multi-analytical approach will be further adopted, involving the study of experimental briquettes fired at various temperature ranges using optical microscopy (OM) to complement the minero-petrographic analysis. Additionally, cathodoluminescence on thin sections will be performed at the Archéosciences Laboratory of the University of Bordeaux Montaigne. This catalogue is part of a broader project aimed at reconstructing the sets of vessels used between the 7th and 10th centuries AD in north Tuscany, as well as understanding the trading dynamics of that period. Determining the provenance and distribution of these ceramics is crucial, as the movement of archaeological ceramics from their production centers to their find spots is related to various human activities such as trade, exchange, and mobility. Therefore, identifying the origins of both coarse-wares and fine-wares can provide significant insights into historical trade patterns.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

In the past, the river served multiple functions. It was essential for providing food and water, for waste disposal, navigation and transport. Infrastructures such as mills, breweries, fortifications and fishponds could be found along its banks. The course of the river Senne and its side branches has changed drastically across history. As the landscape and the city developed, the river’s flow was adapted in natural and artificial ways. Today, many questions remain unanswered concerning the evolution of the Senneriver valley, and the general human-environment interactions across history. Recent (geo)archaeological research conducted under the auspices of urban.brussels, the Brussels Regional Administration in charge of the archaeological heritage, has shown the tremendous archaeological potential of the river valley to reach a renewed understanding of the development of the Senne and its branches. Therefore, the RETS project aims to provide a synthesis of the archaeological, environmental and historical data from the Senne valley within the historical center of Brussels, starting from the Holocene until the 19th century. The research will generate maps and 3D-models which will be integrated in the publicly accessible regional cartographic platform BruGIS.

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2024 in Nicosia.\nArchaeological research frequently places the remains of domestic environments in the epicenter of discourse, aiming to monitor and comprehend the social organization of past societies. Regarding the Late Bronze Age in Cyprus, though, research usually emphasizes on the elite dwellings and practices. While previous research has made significant progress in investigating the social complexity of the Late Cypriot communities, ongoing research is still far from thoroughly understanding the foundations of these societies. For this reason, a bottom-up approach is needed, focusing on the smallest social units, i.e., households. These structures can only be decoded through an in-depth analysis and interpretation of their functions and behaviors, which can be challenging. Nevertheless, as Wilk highlights, only by tracing these functions, ongoing research can break into the “black box” of households. Ethnographic parallels, especially of pre-industrial societies, are invaluable to this process. Although we cannot directly project the social processes of later communities onto the Late Cypriot period, ethnographic parallels shed light on traditional –and at times forgotten– everyday practices. Therefore, this paper attempts to connect Late Cypriot household practices to the ethnographic record, aiming to provide an in-depth understanding of the activities occuring within Late Cypriot habitation units and, thus, their socioeconomic organization.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

In the case study of the Late Neolithic pile dwelling Mooswinkel at the lake Mondsee in Austria, dung, botanical macro- and microremains, as well as invertebrates identified the sediment as stable manure from goat, sheep and cattle farming. Furthermore, the season of the layer formation could be recognized. Materials investigated included pollen, bryophytes, plant fruits and seeds, leaves, branches and bud scales of woody plants, as well as insect remains. In addition, plant microremains in dung were analysed. The results of this multi-material study show that leaf hay and grass hay were used as fodder during the winter season. The impact of fodder acquisition and pasturing on the forest could be reconstructed, showing the formation of a mosaic landscape of natural and semi-natural habitats.\nThe research presented here was published in 2023.

    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA seminar series in December 2024.\nUjina-Collahuasi is an archaeological site located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, renowned as a major center for copper production during the pre-Inca and Inca periods. Pre-Hispanic metallurgists utilized bench-shaped granodiorite furnaces to smelt ore, leveraging the wind to achieve high temperatures and extract copper in the form of metallic beads. The resulting slag, rich in silicon, exhibits various mineralogical phases, notably yellow-green or yellow-orange phases that are of particular interest. These phases, rich in copper and silicon, may be attributed to the prevalence of chrysocolla among the ores used.\nThis study focuses on a characterization of chrysocolla, a copper silicate with an amorphous and controversial structure. At ambient temperature, several analytical techniques (PIXE, SEM-EDS, and solid-state NMR) were employed to overcome challenges related to its variable chemical composition and disordered crystalline structure. At high temperatures, the thermal decomposition of chrysocolla was investigated by heating several samples to different temperatures and characterizing them using various techniques (optical microscopy, XRD, IR spectroscopy, SEM-EDS). Additionally, an in-situ study was conducted, providing XRD scans of a sample subjected to increasing temperatures.\nThe results obtained enhance our understanding of the transformation of chrysocolla observed in the pre-Hispanic slag from Collahuasi and the evolution of metallurgical techniques. Previous studies have been supplemented by analyzing slags from excavations in the Ujina 10 sector, including three furnaces dated to different periods. The objective was to identify any changes in copper reduction techniques between the pre-Inca and the Inca occupation.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

I wrote my bachelor’s thesis on this topic and will continue this research during my master’s studies at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest. I collected nearly 40 fragments of candlesticks and chandeliers from three museums from one of the largest counties in Hungary, Bács-Kiskun county. From these, I selected seven pieces for XRF analysis, which I conducted at the HUN-REN Institute for Nuclear Research with the help of Dr. Furu Enikő. To help date these objects, I relied on the work of Josef Riederer, who developed a database and a method for identifying the approximate age of any Nuremberger yellow brass objects. He examined late medieval and early modern grave plates made from this alloy in a graveyard in Nuremberg and realized that a specific composition of yellow brass was used during particular time periods. Due to their excellent datability, he was able to connect specific compositions to distinct time periods. After hundreds of compositional analyses, Riederer was able to determine with certainty that any type of Nuremberger yellow brass cast objects can be dated to a few decades. The aim of my presentation is to demonstrate the use of Riederer’s method on late medieval and early modern yellow candlesticks using XRF technology, while highlighting its potentials and limitations.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nThis study examines the social structure of communities that inhabited the area of present-day Western Hungary between 2200/2100 and 1600/1500 BC, using archaeometric methods for sex determination, radiocarbon dating, and dietary reconstruction based on excavated burials. During this period, the region functioned as a cultural borderland between the inhumation funerary traditions of the Central European Únětice culture and the cremation rites practiced by groups of the Carpathian Basin, such as the Kisapostag and Transdanubian Encrusted Pottery cultures. Within this context, our research focuses on the previously underexplored Gáta-Wieselburg communities, which are notable for their inhumation burial practices. In addition to archaeological and anthropological analysis at Hungarian sites associated with this culture, we conducted stable isotope and geochemical studies at two cemeteries in Nagycenk (61 burials in total), both distinguished by their rich assemblages of status-related grave goods. By integrating observations for funerary practices, anthropological data, and peptide-based sex identification, our study aims to explore the emergence and extent of gender and age-based social differentiation within these communities. A further key question is whether the grave goods and isotopic evidence for diet reflect patterns of emerging permanent social stratification in the Middle Bronze Age.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nSince the 19th century, bone tools made from the long bones of large ungulates have been the subject of interest in both Hungarian and international research. Contrary to earlier interpretations some of the finds in the Carpathian Basin may have actually been bone fishing net weights in the Middle Ages, but a large number of objects identified as bone skates have also been found. In order to shed light on the function of the medieval and early modern bones, I carried out use-wear analysis, which are closely related to experimental archaeology. To determine the function of the objects and understand their use, I also included ethnographic parallels in the study. During the experiment, I was able to perform the method of skating known from medieval descriptions and compare the use-wear traces on the bones with those observed on the archaeological objects, thus proving that some of the finds were indeed used for skating on ice.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nDuring the excavation of a late Avar-period cemetery in Gyomaendrőd, Hungary in February 2023, the archaeologists of the Munkácsy Mihály Museum (MMM) observed an unusual feature in grave S113, located between the lower right ribs. They identified a relatively large, calcinated anomaly. A remnant of a cyst caused by a parasite infection likely developed in the liver was successfully recovered. This discovery is important because such archaeological cysts are known from fewer than ten publications worldwide. Echinococcus granulosus is a tapeworm that causes cystic echinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease. Humans are intermediate hosts, becoming infected by ingesting eggs from contaminated dog feces. In the human host, the parasite larvae migrate to different organs, mostly liver. It grows, creating hydatid cysts that can reach 2-3 cm in diameter annually. The carrier may remain unaware of the infection for years. In the case of the cyst found in Gyomaendrőd, we are particularly fortunate because multiple institutions have joined the research. Collaborators include colleagues from the MMM and the HNM, as well as researchers from HUN-REN, the National Center for Public Health and Pharmacy, and Semmelweis University. In addition to SEM, Raman spectroscopy, and micro XRF analyses, we also conducted genetic and micro-CT examinations. Our goal is to thoroughly investigate the cyst, which will not only expand our knowledge about this disease but also allow us to infer information about the hygienic and health conditions of the population from that period.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nIn the early 20th century, Neolithic studies in central Iberia were strongly influenced by Bosch Gimpera’s theory of Cultural Circles, which classified the region within the so-called Cave Culture. By the late 20th century, however, new archaeological discoveries and the introduction of radiocarbon dating prompted a significant reassessment of this framework. The Middle Tagus Basin emerged as a key area for understanding these shifts. This paper re-evaluates the role of the Middle Tagus Basin, strategically located between the Atlantic and Mediterranean spheres, in the broader Neolithization process of the Iberian Peninsula. It presents preliminary petrographic data on pottery production from this region, based on both petrographic thin-section analysis and macroscopic examination of ceramic assemblages from Neolithic sites. Additionally, it offers a comprehensive review of all published radiocarbon dates for this period in the area, recalibrated using the IntCal20 curve. The study explores the correlation between chronological data, archaeological contexts, and ceramic technological traits, aiming to define the distinctive features of Neolithic pottery in the Middle Tagus and to reassess their role in the spread of Neolithic traditions across the peninsula. Ultimately, this research raises a broader question: to what extent can the Iberian Plateau be considered a peripheral territory, dependent on other Neolithic centers such as the Levant or southern Iberia?\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nOne of the most important issues of the technological analysis of pottery forming and surface treatment is to establish a relationship between the observed traces of forming and surface treatment and the characteristics of the pottery making (e.g. techniques, tools, drying levels) that resulted in these kinds of traces. To define this connection, ethnographical or experimental references are essential, allowing us to observe both the process of pottery making and the traces of the created vessel. Several pottery forming and surface treatment techniques can be identified in the Early and Middle Copper Age in the Carpathian Basin (4500/4450–3800/3700 calBC). Some of these are widely known from experimental and ethnographical studies (e.g. modelling). However, other techniques have little or no parallel in other contexts (e.g. reverse coiling technique) and even the well-known techniques are often problematic. Although numerous works discuss these well-known techniques, not everyone understands the same thing under the same expression (e.g. burnishing or polishing). Therefore, we created an experimental reference collection that focuses on these lesser-known or problematic forming and surface treatment techniques. This was followed by the comparison of the experimental and archaeological vessels. For this, we used a multiscalar analytical approach, including the macro- and microscopic examination of the samples. The latter was carried out with laser scanning confocal microscopy to obtain quantitative data from the surface, besides the qualitative observations. As a result, we gained an in-depth understanding of the Copper Age pottery-making processes.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nAncient Tenea was a significant city in the eastern vicinity of ancient Corinth, which flourished throughout antiquity. Since 2013, remnants of the ancient city have been excavated in the context of the systematic archaeological research, which is conducted between the area of modern Chiliomodi - Klenia. During the excavation of the city, a significant amount of archaic pottery was collected, both in residential areas and in its cemeteries. Some of the ceramic vessels have no similar shape in the international literature. This led the excavators to the assumption of the existence of local pottery production. To confirm this assumption, pottery sherds from three different sites were examined through archaeometric means. These came from an archaic deposit in ancient Tenea, an archaic cemetery near Ancient Corinth, and an archaic deposit at Mageri site. The present study examines whether Tenea’s archaic samples present similarities or differences in comparison to the archaic pottery of Mageri site and ancient Corinth. Examination of the ceramics was conducted through optical analysis and SEM-EDS in the laboratory of the Faculty of Sciences of the Aristotle University in Thessaloniki. The study of ceramics showed that the samples from all the excavations were very fine-grained and calcareous. Differences can be detected considering the color of the fabric and the firing properties. These elements could indicate a different clay origin or different techniques used in this pottery production or even different workshops.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nIn historical periods, trade networks in West Africa are documented through written sources and exotic artifacts. However, both are rare and represent only a limited portion of past exchange activities. The provenance analysis of ceramics, as a common find category, can offer new insights into the movement of artifacts. Our approach follows a two-step process. First, sherds that were likely produced locally were selected from archaeological sites across various regions of West Africa. This selection was based on attributes such as shape, decoration, and petrofabric. These sherds were then subjected to geochemical analysis to determine the regional chemical composition of the ceramics. For this purpose, we used portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF), which enables the rapid analysis of a large number of samples. In doing so, we were able to establish geochemically distinct reference groups for many regions of West Africa. In the second step, sherds identified as non-local based on their attributes were analyzed to verify their non-local origin. Using the reference groups, it is also possible to assign these vessels to potential source regions, thus tracing interregional connections in medieval West Africa. While pXRF is well-suited for mass sampling, it also has certain limitations. Therefore, selected sherds are subjected to more precise geochemical and mineralogical analyses. These complementary methods provide a more detailed understanding of the clays used in pottery production. The combination of rapid and precise geochemical and mineralogical approaches enables the efficient analysis of a large number of samples, while producing robust results.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nCeramic petrography plays a fundamental role in archaeometric studies, offering insights into raw materials choice, manufacturing techniques, and provenance. However, the method is time-consuming and relies heavily on expert interpretation. In this context, emerging AI-based tools offer promising opportunities to enhance the efficiency, reproducibility, and scalability of thin-section analysis. This study presents an experimental application of TagLab, an open-source software originally developed for the analysis of large-scale orthomosaics of marine corals, to the analysis of microphotographs of ceramic thin sections. The aim is to explore how TagLab’s AI-assisted segmentation features, particularly its trainable classifiers, can be adapted to automatically recognise and annotate petrographic components such as inclusions, pores, and matrix areas in different ceramic fabrics. The application of this tool to new scenarios showed several challenges, especially due to differences in scale, resolution, and the use of polarised light in microscopy. Nevertheless, with appropriate image pre-processing and calibration, TagLab proved capable of supporting semi-automated annotation and providing both visual and quantitative data outputs. The approach offers potential benefits in terms of speed, repeatability, and partial reduction of interpretative subjectivity. While still in progress, this work highlights the potential of AI-driven tools in ceramic petrography and encourages their integration in archaeometric workflows.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nThis paper offers new perspectives on the use of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis for the identification of calcite types in lime mortars. Calcite (CaCO3) is the predominant component of lime binders, which is obtained by burning limestone rocks or other calcareous materials. The resulting pyrogenic product is often mixed with geogenic and biogenic components during the production of the mortar. FTIR has proved to be an effective analytical tool in the distinction between pure geogenic, pure biogenic, and pure pyrogenic calcites; thus, this paper aims at demonstrating the potential of this technique in distinguishing also mixtures’ proportions. The methodology is based on previously published studies proving how the shape, height, and area of the main calcite peaks – in particular v2 and v4 – in FTIR spectra change according to the formation process of the calcitic material. The present paper reveals how the calculation of the v2/v4 area ratios, can indicate the presence of mixed types of calcites, and aid in estimating the percentages. The results obtained show how – in the presence of a valuable reference database – it is possible to distinguish ranges of limestone:lime mixtures. This methodological study was applied on a set of samples collected in the district of Paphos, in South Western Cyprus. The geogenic and biogenic samples are representative of the main geological formations and faunal species of the region, while the archaeological samples were collected at the site of Nea Paphos. The pyrogenic calcite specimens were produced in controlled laboratory setting.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

My research takes place in Komárom-Esztergom County, a few kilometres from the Danube, therefore the Roman ripa Pannonica and the quondam auxiliary fort of Crumerum. To understand the rural settlement system in the 1st–4th centuries, I focus on conducting non-invasive, mainly geophysical surveys at two sites (Lábatlan–Rábl valley and Nyergesújfalu–Gunyhóalji fields) using GPR and magnetometer. At both locations there are several buildings with stone foundations, which is not atypical for Pannonian vici, but certainly shows a higher level of development. I complement the geophysical component with field surveys and examination of the archaeological finds from the surface. I compare the results of the sites to each other as well as to the wider Pannonian context of the buildings and other objects found during the surveys. In the long term, I would like to extend the research with more sites to a micro-regional level in order to gain a deeper understanding of this area in the Roman period.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nThis study investigates the raw material and production techniques employed in the Roman wall-painting fragments collected from the Sandrigo Estate, east of the River Port of Aquileia. 10 representative samples were chosen for analysis from nuclei collected from secondary debris. Transmitted- Light Polarized Optical Microscopy (TL-OM) on thin sections was adopted for petrographic analysis of preparation mortars. Such analysis has unfolded a progressive evolution in the choice of raw materials employed in the preparation of the wall-paintings. In fact, stylistic and petrographic research on wall fragments from Aquileia conducted in past years aided in the determination of a chronological framework ranging from the 2nd c. BCE to the 4th c. CE (Dilaria et al. 2021). By comparing the results of the analyses of the Sandrigo samples with this reference “baseline” it is therefore possible to reconstruct their probable chronology. The main characterizing element relies on the preparation of the uppermost intonachino layer. Most of the samples were made adopting methods typical of the Republican/Early Imperial periods, characterized by distinct layers of tectorium and an intonachino composed almost entirely of sparry calcite. On the other hand, other samples appear to follow preparation practices of the Late Antique period, where intonachino was made with common fluvial sand. Moreover, via Raman Spectroscopy pigments have been characterized. These include the common Roman palette (hematite, carbon black, goethite), but interestingly the best executed samples were also the ones where more expensive pigments were detected such as cinnabar, sometimes mixed with Egyptian blue.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nThis research presents the preliminary results of the compositional characterization of the structural and lining mortars of two relevant Roman Middle Imperial period buildings in the ancient city of Nora (Sardinia, Italy). Specifically, the objects of the analysis are the thermal complex of ‘Terme a Mare’ and the aqueduct, both built around the 2nd-3rd century AD. Most of the analysed samples are hydraulic mortars enriched with different types of pozzolanic aggregates that are primarily constituted by pyroclastic material such as pumices/tuffs, obsidians, or ceramic fragments. Mortar samples and pyroclastic aggregates were analysed adopting a multi-analytical protocol. Mortars were analysed, coupling Transmitted-Light Polarized Optical Microscopy (TL-OM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (SEM-EDS), providing a detailed characterization of their compositions and production techniques. Moreover, SEM-EDS together with XRF (X-Ray Fluorescence) were adopted to analyse the pozzolanic volcanic aggregates and to define their provenance based on the comparison with geochemical reference literature. The preliminary archaeometric analysis allowed us to investigate the petro-mineralogical compositions of each mortar sample, leading to the identification of four distinct mortar groups: aerial lime mortars, pumice/tuff-enriched lime mortars and cocciopesto enriched with obsidians were mainly employed for structural purposes, whereas cocciopesto enriched with pumice/tuff was primarily used for lining of hydraulic infrastructures. Through the geochemical analysis it was possible to establish that pumices and tuffs were imported from the Phlegraean volcanic district (Naples), while obsidian most presumably came from the Monte Arci outcrop (southwestern Sardinia).\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

Its pottery assemblage includes all known pottery types of the period. Despite this, no suitable clay sources or evidence of local pottery production (e.g. workshops) have been identified in the vicinity. The aim of our research is to determine the potential origin of these vessels and to narrow down the source areas of the tempers used. In addition to petrographic analysis, we applied several analytical techniques including Raman microscopy, SEM-EDS, cathodoluminescence (CL) microscopy and spectroscopy, and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). Petrographic results allowed us to define five petrographic groups (T1–T5). For several of these, a likely origin in known pottery workshops could be proposed, including those at Sándorfalva–Eperjes, Nagymágocs–Paptanya, and Üllő pottery workshops. XRD data provided estimates of the firing temperatures for each group. We also attempted to identify the source region of the granitoid tempering found in Group T5 attributed to the Nagymágocs–Paptanya workshop. This was done through comparative analysis with granitoid rock samples using CL spectroscopy. The results indicate that the closest match – based on textural, mineralogical, and CL spectral characteristics of feldspars – points to the Codru granitoids of the Apuseni Mountains, Romania. These findings contribute to our understanding of regional pottery production and distribution networks during the Late Sarmatian period.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nThe present study examines the corrosion patterns of some selected cast copper coins from the early historic site Tekttha, Naogaon, Bangladesh, which have been subjected to prolonged burial conditions. Corrosion mechanisms have led to the formation of distinct layers of varying thicknesses, impacting the preservation state of these coins. To characterize these corrosion products and assess their implications for coin deterioration, this research combined numismatic study with micro X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The micro-XRD analysis confirms the presence of copper oxides, such as cuprite and tenorite. This indicates that initial corrosion stages are likely formed during manufacture or usage. In addition, the green patina can be ascribed to a copper hydroxychloride, such as paramelaconite or botallackite, implying secondary corrosion owing to chlorine-rich burial environments. The presence of quartz and calcite further indicates the burial soil contamination. Although the studied coins do not show any visible sign of bronze disease, the microstructure analysis using SEM backscattered images reveals several corrosion voids in the metallic core. These highlight the coin’s metallic susceptibility to further degradation. However, to contextualize these findings within a broader framework, this study integrates metallurgical analysis with numismatic typology and historical perspectives. Thus, this research demonstrates the importance of using a multi-disciplinary approach to enhance the current understanding of early coinage production, use, and post-depositional transformation. This research, therefore, contributes not only to corrosion studies but also to the cultural and technological history of early historic coinage in South Asia.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

The statue is sculpted from fine-grained white calcitic marble, prompting an investigation into its origin using archaeometric methodology. Stable isotope ratios (δ¹³C and δ¹⁸O) were measured and plotted against a comprehensive reference dataset of over 5,700 samples from major ancient quarries. While the isotopic results alone showed significant overlap among sources such as Paros, Dokimeion, and Pentelicon, as well as local sources, a conclusive identification required enhanced resolution. To that end, trace element concentrations were determined using ICP-MS following selective dissolution with hot HNO₃, thus targeting the carbonate matrix while excluding silicates. The data were subjected to multivariate statistical analysis (SPSS, STATISTICA), which successfully assigned the marble to the Pentelicon quarry in Attica (Greece). This methodological framework demonstrates the power of scientific archaeometry to address long-standing archaeological questions. The case underscores the importance of white marble provenance studies in reconstructing artistic production, trade mechanisms, and economic integration across the Roman Empire. By pinpointing the origin of this marble in Attica, the study illuminates the logistical reach and cultural priorities underpinning Roman supply chains in the provinces.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nDuring the politically fragmented Second Intermediate Period (c. 1800–1550 BCE), temple and tomb restoration served both technical and ideological functions. Literary inscriptions record royal and priestly mandates to repair sacred architecture, yet little is known about the actual materials and techniques employed. This study combines epigraphic analysis of restoration texts (e.g. stelae of Amunrepair commissions) with archaeometric investigation of surviving mortar and pigment samples from key Second Intermediate sites (Abydos, Karnak, Luxor). Petrographic microscopy and portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) analyses reveal a consistent use of locally sourced Nile-sediment limestone fines in repair mortars, mixed with a gypsum binder. Raman spectroscopy of painted relief fragments identifies iron-oxide red and Egyptian blue pigments applied both in original and renewed coatings, while SEM-EDS shows traces of plant-gum adhesive. Textual evidence often refers to smꜥwy (“restorer”) and qd (“re-built”), underscoring the ritual significance of “renewal” alongside structural repair. By correlating these material findings with the chronological and administrative details in the inscriptions, the paper demonstrates how restoration functioned as an expression of royal legitimacy and community identity under divided rule. This interdisciplinary approach not only reconstructs ancient technical know-how but also highlights the continuity of restoration traditions that maintained Egypt’s cultural memory during periods of upheaval.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nThe material history of Taiwanese ceramics reflects a multi-layered colonial and political legacy. During Japanese colonial rule (1895–1945), Taiwan’s primary source of daily-use tableware gradually shifted from mainland Chinese to Japanese imports. By the 1940s, Japanese products dominated the local market. However, Japanese-established factories in Taiwan, such as the Taiwan Ceramic Co., Ltd. (台灣窯業株式會社) in Beitou, were also producing similar wares within the colony. Blue-and-white bowls with crane motifs (鶴紋碗) are commonly recovered in archaeological sites in both Japan and Taiwan. These bowls appear visually similar, making it difficult to determine their origin through stylistic analysis alone. Another recurring decorative scheme, featuring blue and pink glazes, suggests a shared visual repertoire that circulated between Japan and colonial Taiwan and continued into Taiwan’s postwar ceramic production. This study applies non-invasive Raman and XRF spectroscopy to investigate the representative ceramic sherds’ material and technical characteristics. Building on prior research showing that phase identification (Raman) and elemental composition (XRF) can reveal raw material sources and firing conditions, the analysis focuses on underglaze blue and pink colorants and trace impurities. The results reveal distinct regional patterns: gold-based pink glazes in Japanese ceramics, manganese-based pink in Taiwanese products, and variations in cobalt blue formulations, all contributing to regional identification. This comparative research advances understanding of the material culture of ceramic tableware in Japan and colonial Taiwan, tracing its development from raw materials and production techniques to decorative practices and the transregional circulation of glaze recipe knowledge in 20th-century East Asia.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nIn forensic entomology, knowledge about insects is primarily applied to determine the time of death or certain circumstances of the deceased, rather than the location itself. The body of the deceased interacts with macro- and micro-environmental factors, influencing the appearance, behavior, and development of necrophagous insects. In Hungary, the modern history of forensic entomology dates back to the 19th century. However, analyses of insect samples have had little precedent until the 20th century. The earliest written record is from 1934. The first expert examination in a criminal case was conducted in 1963, which garnered significant international attention. Subsequently, such analyses were rarely performed in Hungary until the 2000s. Moreover, until now, no similar analysis has been documented for archaeological samples. Despite the methodological similarities between archaeological excavation techniques and forensic procedures—differing mainly in the time scale—both disciplines aim to record and document all observable phenomena as accurately as possible. During archaeological excavations of three ancient and early medieval cemeteries, we collected and examined insect samples. In samples from Szécsény and Veszprém, we identified species belonging to the order Diptera (flies), mostly from the family Calliphoridae, known as blowflies with metallic coloring. The early medieval grave of the Honfoglalás (Conquest era) period in Csomád revealed additional interesting findings alongside these flies.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

The ceramic style is characteristic of the Otomani II culture and the absolute data that we have places the habitation of the tell between 1892-1631 BC.\nIn this study we try to see the microscopical details of the northern profile (3.42 m) of the last excavation in the tell from 2023. On this matter we first collected 12 samples and another batch of 9 samples later. With these samples we cover almost every archaeological context that is present in the northern profile, including construction materials or fillings from different stages of the tell. We collected the samples in aluminium boxes, then we air-dried them for a while. We treated them with polyesteric resin and put them in vacuum. After each sample was dry, we polished them and then cut them into thin sections.\nThis research is approaching the site through geological methods. We focus on the sediments and the organic material that is found in the anthropogenic levels. The reason of this approach is observing the dynamic of the households and structures as well as the expendability of a space in the Middle Bronze Age. Through micromorphology we also focus on the evolution of the building technique, whether intentional or accidental.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "title": "Identifying Surface Treatments on Medieval Metal Artefacts",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA Workshop 2025 in Budapest.\nThe research of surface treatments was always marginal in the field of archaeometallurgy. Their popularity is still highly uncertain within most of the medieval material culture, sometimes their function is unclear as well. This case study showcases identified surface treatments - gilding, silvering and tinning – on several artefacts from the Middle Ages using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry and optical microscope. The main questions of the topics are the following: what are the best analytical methods for identifying surface methods?; how popular were gilding, silvering and tinning in medieval times? The results of the research were very interesting and instructive. To begin with, on several artefacts the surface treatments could only be identified with the analytical methods, which also means that they were misinterpreted previously. The latter is more prominent in the case of 5 S-end lock rings, which were all originally interpreted as silver artefacts; using the analytical methods all of them could be identified as silvered bronze jewellery. This result shows that researches like this are not only important from an archaeometallurgical perspective, but also very useful for classical archaeology too. My study not only acknowledges these problems, but also offers a practical method for future researches into different surface treatments.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "title": "Colored sculptures under study: archaeometrical and symbolic approaches to pigments in pre-Columbian Ecuador",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA seminar series in March 2025.\nThe pre-Columbian sculptures housed in art museums (such as the Quai Branly in Paris and the British Museum), decontextualized from their archaeological context, can still be historically relevant and provide insights into prehistoric societies? This question arose during my work as a curator at a pre-Columbian art museum in Ecuador. In addressing it, I pursued two main approaches: investigating the symbolism of colors and materials in pre-Columbian America and establishing the chaîne opératoire of the pigments observed on the shelves of the museum. To this end, several post-firing painted ceramic statues produced during the Regional Development period (500 BC - 500 AD) on the coast of Ecuador were studied.\nFirst, in order to delve into the chaîne opératoire, the pigments and chromatic layers were examined using binocular magnification, SEM, XRD, XRF, and Raman spectroscopy in collaboration with various Ecuadorian institutions. One of the findings was that, despite employing similar color schemes, these pigments were used in comparable ways but sourced from different pigment materials. Furthermore, there existed a profound symbolic connection regarding color across the Americas. Thus, this study sought to demonstrate that the thousands of artifacts in museums are amenable to archaeological study, reinstating their intrinsic historical value.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA seminar series in April 2025.\nSTON is open-source software designed to make microscopic image analysis faster and easier for archaeologists. Unlike existing microscopic imaging software, which is primarily built for the natural sciences, STON is tailored to archaeological research, allowing users to cluster and compare multiple images simultaneously in a simple, user-friendly workspace. With features such as freehand sorting and synchronised zoom, STON helps users efficiently group samples and analyse compositional characteristics. By streamlining these processes, it enhances ceramic paste analysis and petrographic grouping. Developed openly on GitHub, STON is free to use and fully adaptable, with a Python-based source code that can be customised for different projects.\nFor more information, visit the documentation page.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA seminar series in June 2025.\nAromatic plants, herbs, and resins have long shaped human experiences—serving not only as olfactory markers in ritual and spiritual life but also as potent agents in healing, hygiene, and medicine. In ancient societies, the lines between incense, remedy, and ritual were often blurred, especially in regions like Arabia where aromatic substances held multifaceted roles in both daily routines and ceremonial practices.\nThis talk introduces archaeo-metabolomics, the study of small molecules (metabolites), as a powerful new lens for exploring the biochemical fingerprints of ancient plant-based practices. Moving beyond traditional text-based and typological approaches, metabolomics applies high-resolution metabolite profiling to archaeological materials, such as ceramic residues and soils – to detect a broad range of metabolites, including alkaloids, terpenes, and flavonoids. These molecular traces enable the reconstruction of complex human-plant interactions, from therapeutic formulations to incense practices.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper was presented at the YRA seminar series in September 2025.\nEgyptian blue is the earliest known artificially produced inorganic pigment, which from its first appearance in Early Bronze Age Egypt remained an intrinsic part of the artistic palette over several millennia. The application of Egyptian blue was not limited to being used as a pigment only, as it also served as a raw material for the production of small objects like beads, scarabs, and figurines. From the material science standpoint, Egyptian blue is a multi-phase material comprising crystals of cuprorivaite (CaCuSi4O10) embedded in an amorphous glass phase along with possible remains of partially reacted raw materials. While the chemical and physical properties of Egyptian blue are fairly well understood, our grasp on the broader context of its production remains limited. Being a high-temperature process, the production of Egyptian blue necessitates the use of crucibles. The present talk will focus on Egyptian blue crucibles from LBA Qantir, Iron Age Kom Tuman, and Hellenistic/Roman Kom Helul in an attempt to highlight the diachronic change in Egyptian blue production.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

We are aware of the difficulty to define the term “early career”. As such, we attempt to take into account the varied backgrounds and situations of researchers coming from diverse scientific communities and countries. After some discussion in early 2024, we agreed on the definition of ECRs as researchers up to 6 years after completion of their PhD without a permanent position, such as a lectureship or professorship."

    "section": "The journey",
    "text": "The journey\nThe idea for the workshop began in 2016 in a discussion about why so few ECRs are joining the German archaeological sciences conference “Archäometrie & Denkmalpflege” (Archaeometry & preservation of historic monuments). Besides the psychological barrier of delivering the first conference presentation in front of very distinguished researchers, it was realised that the archaeological sciences are often dispersed among many different institutes and work groups, making it very difficult for ECRs to get in contact with peers.\nSince the first workshop in Frankfurt in 2017, all YRA workshops stayed true to the original idea. While originally aiming for the German community, the workshops soon became orientated towards an international audience with about 50% of the participants in the second edition being internationals. Already in 2019, it became an international workshop series organised at an institution outside of Germany for the first time. The latest step was to purposefully keep the hybrid format to become more inclusive to colleagues unable to attend the workshop in person while keeping the benefits of in-person meetings for networking.\nWith every new edition, the structures for YRA have become more and more professionalised. Beginning with the processing of abstracts and registration in 2019, this was followed by the logo, mail address, and a first webpage in 2022, the last of which resulted in this webpage and the mailing list in 2023. Consequently, workload shifted more and more towards the local organisation while templates now exist for most other tasks. This, and the active support from previous organisers whenever needed, makes the YRA workshops particularly suited to gather first experiences as workshop organiser. This is what keeps YRA true to its motto: for ECRs by ECRs.\nSo, what’s new? Starting in 2024, the YRA will organise a seminar series with lectures from fellow ECRs on a wide range of topics in archaeological science that are featured in the workshops.\nIf you are interested in organising the next workshop or have ideas for additional events, please get in touch via mail."

    "text": "The YRA logo\nDesigning a logo for YRA was not an easy task. Without a doubt, the biggest challenge was to create a logo that represents the huge breadth of disciplines working together in the archaeological sciences and represents the target group. Given the interdisciplinary ethos of the YRA workshops, it was decided that an abstract logo would be the most suitable.\nThe logo writes “YRA” embedded in a spectra-like line with each letter having a different colour and the grey coloured parts as connecting lines. The trowel-shaped arrows outline the negative space (“hole”) of the letters R and A and are inspired by the markers for characteristic peaks. The colours do not have a special meaning. They were chosen because this combination is colour-blind friendly and pleasing to the eyes of the persons involved in the design process."

During her PhD studies, she was fully embedded in the field team, designing recovery protocols, supervising recovery in the field, and analysing resulting material, thereby becoming an expert in the flora of the Aegean and the current models of the economy and social organization of the first millennium BCE.\nThroughout her PhD studies she was also awarded two Erasmus+ Programs; one took place in 2018, in the School of Archaeology of the University of Oxford and the second in 2021 in the Humana, IMF-SCIC Institute, in Barcelona. Both Erasmus programs focused on microbotanical studies and specifically the analysis of starch granules retrieved from the interior of ceramic pots, in order to reconstruct cooking and consumption patterns in the 1st millennium BCE in Greece. She has also held the British School of Athens Centenary Bursary in order to conduct similar research in Oxford related to the Keros research and excavation project of the University of Cambridge (2019).\nIn MedisFood, Kyriaki holds a Post-Doctorate position where she explores the long durée of plant choices of the 3rd/2nd millennium BCE, the varieties of grapes and olives exploited in the biggest islands of the Eastern Mediterranean, Crete and Cyprus, and addresses key questions related to the rise of complex societies in both islands. The simultaneous analysis of both islands allows not only the understanding of the unique social and agricultural structures of each island, but also the definition of patterns and tendencies that may have appeared at the same time on both regions and which may reflect adaptations, influences and ultimately connections with other areas, or even directly between Crete and Cyprus."
