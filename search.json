    "title": "The clay of a gateway community in Cyprus: domestic pottery from Soli",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper sets out to investigate Hellenistic and Roman domestic pottery excavated by the Swedish Cyprus Expedition in the location of Soli, Cyprus, to outline a possible local production of pottery in the near vicinity of the city-state and to examine the connection between the copper-producing areas of Troodos and the northern coastline. Extensive scientific analyses of ceramics found in Soli are essential for the ongoing discussion of a probable local production of ceramics in Soli. The aim is to contribute to the debate of whether a production of domestic pottery took place in the area by studying material found in the actual location. Local production and distribution of such allow for further debate on the social networks and financial role of the city-state of Soli during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. I analysed 50 samples of cooking ware and plain ware pottery by petrography (thin sections) and portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (pXRF), and I included five locally produced amphorae of the Mavrovouni and Skouriotissa types from different locations. Moreover, I had access to previously prepared thin sections of similar types of amphorae found in the Lagoudera area of Troodos as comparable material for my study. Before starting the scientific analyses, I established a preliminary typology based on comparable material and macroscopic descriptions of the fabric. The initial registrations indicated locally produced groups of pottery, which did not compare with pottery found in other locations in and outside Cyprus during the same period.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "title": "The “production” of Minoan red serpentinite",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In the Bronze Age (Minoan) palatial site of Malia, Crete, in the so-called “Quartier Mu” of the Protopalatial period (1900-1700 BCE), were found, among particularly rich and varied artefact assemblages, c. 25 vases made of “red serpentinite”. Serpentinite is a metamorphic rock that typically ranges from grey-green to grey-blue, and its red variant, which is much rarer, has not yet been found in natural outcrops in Crete. Because of this, and the fact that its red colour is typically associated with high-temperature metamorphism, it seems that Minoan red serpentinite has not been transformed through natural geological processes but by anthropogenic heating actions. However, the exact conditions of this firing process, as well as whether it was intentional (craftsmanship) or accidental (destruction by fire in Quartier Mu), have not yet been assessed nor demonstrated. This talk aims to address these issues by examining the different potential heating conditions that lead to the modification of the colour of the stone, arguing for an intentional heating process. This will be achieved through laboratory experimental heating supported by geochemical and mineralogical analyses, and by comparisons with the archaeological material. It will additionally provide a preliminary overview of other red serpentinite artifacts found in Minoan Crete. Finally, because Quartier Mu has revealed different types of production linked in part to the elite spheres (metal, pottery and seal production), it will be proposed that the production of red serpentinite at Malia may have emerged thanks to the emulation between the various crafts taking place in the Quarter.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "title": "Envisioning pre-colombian regional trade patterns through elemental analysis of archaeological ceramics from Western Panama",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Gran Chiriquí, as an archaeological culture area, spans from southern Costa Rica to western Panama and crosses at least three topographic subdivisions – the Pacific Coast, Central Highlands, and the Caribbean Coast – as well as several modern political ones. Of these, the Caribbean Coast is the least studied and has been of little interest archaeologically, primarily in comparison to sites in the Pacific Coast. However, Isla Colón, the largest island in Caribbean Panama, has recently proven unique in the region: the ceramic assemblage from Sitio Drago on Isla Colón’s north shore is more diverse than any known in the region and includes locally-made ceramics, imported wares, and local imitations of exotic styles. To assess the role of Isla Colón in Pre-Columbian trade networks and the ways in which its inhabitants interacted with others in Gran Chiriquí, we performed laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry on archaeological ceramic and clay samples from across Western Panama. The identification of distinct groups based on chemical composition enables us to distinguish possible differences in location of production, or provenance, and thereby establish which ceramic types were being moved and when. This delineation of networks of interaction is based on pottery samples from seven archaeological sites representing three subregions of Gran Chiriquí in the period from AD 1-1500, a period that is traditionally divided into the Aguas Buenas, San Lorenzo, and Chiriquí phases. This collaborative provenance study is pioneering as archaeometric analyses of ceramics have not been undertaken in this area previously.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "title": "Knowledge exchange in pottery production in Neolithic Northwest China: a petrographic study and the resulting development of a digital tool for petrographic image analysis in archaeology",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper explores the potential for long-distance knowledge sharing in the production of Majiayao-style pottery in Neolithic Northwest China through macroscopic and microscopic analyses. The paper is divided into two parts. The first part examines the chaîne opératoire of the pottery production process based on tool-trace analysis, petrography, and comparisons with experimentally fired geological samples. The striking consistency and similarities in raw material selection, construction, and firing techniques among pottery from different sites suggest mechanisms for technological knowledge exchange among Neolithic potters. Given that pottery the most abundant or sole evidence for human activity in the region during the Neolithic, the technological perspective presented in this study proves useful in understanding social connectivity and shared knowledge. The second part presents the development of visualization software to enhance the analysis of petrographic photomicrographs in archaeological research. This idea emerged from the methodological challenges faced during the comparative studies of pottery from different sites and geological samples. Traditional thin-section petrography requires laborious visual comparison of individual samples under a microscope. Existing petrography software, primarily designed for geology, lacks features needed for archaeological research, such as multiple sample comparison. The proposed software allows for the simultaneous viewing of multiple photomicrographs, improving the efficiency of analysing ceramic pastes. Developed openly on GitHub with an OSI-approved license, this software aims to be a sustainable tool, fostering collaboration among archaeologists and software engineers, and applicable to any research involving thin-section petrography.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "title": "Bronze production in Archaic and Classical Northern Greece: An archaeometric approach to the study of bronze objects from Ancient Argilos",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Argilos was founded on the littoral of the Strymonic Gulf in the mid-7th century BCE. Shortly after its foundation, the city became very prosperous, benefiting from good relations with the local Thracian populations, fertile lands, easy access to various commercial markets, and the abundant wood and metal resources the area has been famous for since Antiquity. Through a Greek-Canadian collaboration, archaeological research carried out in Argilos since 1992 has allowed the discovery of a rich material culture, amongst which are found more than a thousand bronze artifacts. The systematic study of the Argilos’ bronze collection was initiated in 2017 with typological analysis. With limited conclusive results, the scope of the study has been widened by using archaeometric methods, such as metallographic, chemical, and isotopic analyses, carried out on 150 artifacts. With the use of these methods, we seek to contribute to the current state of knowledge on archaic and classical metal production in Northern Greece. Indeed, questions concerning the organization of Argilos bronze production, its integration within its regional context in terms of distribution of primary resources and finished products, and exchange of technological knowledge with other production centers will be addressed. During this presentation, results of the metallographic analysis will be studied. Through the discussion of the latter, we will argue that Argilos’ bronze production was subject to a great degree of standardization, demonstrating a high level of mastery of technical metal processes. In addition, the possibility of a vast distribution network going beyond the region will be explored.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "title": "Metalworking materials and practices from Late Antique Rome",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In recent decades, archaeological research in the monumental centre of Rome has revealed a completely new image of the city in Late Antiquity. In particular, the reoccupation of former public spaces for productive activities, among which metalworking seems to have played a prominent role, has been extensively documented. Recent excavations of three metalworking furnaces have yielded a considerable amount of material related to the secondary processing of iron and copper alloys, in particular metal debris and technical ceramics, recorded for the first time in Italy and especially in Rome. The main novelties are two nozzles from bellows at one site and numerous fragments of crucibles from two other sites, which turned out to be kitchenware items repurposed with a refractory lining, revealing an operational pattern for the production of these vessels. All these materials have been subjected to scientific analysis, the results of which, although partial, represent a novelty for the Roman scene and have provided a first, unexpected insight into the alloys and materials used, as well as some of the technological choices made by the metallurgists, showing that the subject merits further study. These studies will allow us to adventure some preliminary answers to archaeologically relevant questions about the economic and social life of Late Antique Rome. This is a very initial approach to larger questions such as the management of resources from a recycling perspective and the potential supply of raw materials.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "title": "Multi-analytical investigation on the carved oriental lacquerwares",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This research project aims to explore the origins and restoration of four lacquerwares at the Oriental Art Museum of Venice using both historical research and multi-scientific methods. The artifacts include three red carved lacquer pieces and one painted lacquer piece, some of which are deteriorating and cracking. Scientific tests will help verify their provenance (China or Japan), as existing literature lacks detailed records. The study combines historical research and materials science to provide comprehensive information for future restoration. Historical research will examine the museum’s collection history and interpret the iconography, hypothesizing possible techniques mentioned in ancient texts. Non-invasive tests using a Digital Microscope, Fiber Optic Reflectance Spectroscopy (FORS), Infrared External Reflection Module, and Raman Spectroscopy will analyze pigments and materials. Micro-samples will be analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), μ-FTIR Spectroscopy, and Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) to identify components, additives, and possibly the origin. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) will study the degradation process. The study aims to enhance the understanding of Asian lacquerware’s craftsmanship and provenance and provide insights into using various scientific instruments for lacquerware analysis, supporting future restoration and preservation efforts.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "title": "µ-LIBS imaging as spatially-resolved and quantitative characterization method for pottery",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In our pursuit of characterizing pottery, we are pioneering a novel approach for multi-analytical characterization through µ-LIBS imaging technique (Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy). This cutting-edge methodology facilitates surface analysis spanning a few centimeters, generating an extensive dataset of spectra, upwards of one million and beyond. LIBS offers comprehensive elemental maps with micrometric resolution, crucial for mineral characterization. Supplementing the capabilities of conventional microscopic petrography, our method enables the identification of the granular fraction, known as the temper, on a straightforward polished section of a sherd. Given the substantial volume of data produced across a large surface area, leveraging machine learning for rapid and automated spectrum processing emerges as a potent tool for recognizing mineral families within a sample. These outcomes can subsequently be harnessed to estimate temper characteristics, akin to the capabilities of quantitative microscopy. The resulting maps expedite the examination of temper proportion relative to clay, encompassing both grain size and shape distributions. Notably, in contrast to other elemental techniques providing an overall composition of a sample, such as XRF, the distinctive advantage of µ-LIBS lies in furnishing spatially-resolved spectra across the entire surface. This enables segmentation, allowing the exclusion of temper contributions from the bulk composition of a sherd. Consequently, a quantitative analysis of the clay alone becomes feasible, facilitating comparisons across different potteries irrespective of the added temper, as it is necessary for Lugdunum’s production. This, in turn, holds promise for enhanced identification of raw material sources and hence the provenance of vessels in future investigations.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "title": "3D visualization and digital recording of sculptures through photogrammetry: An iconometric examination of the Hoysala sculptures",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Iconometry, in the Indian context, refers to the study of the measurements of the sculptures and was referred to as the Talamana system in the ancient scriptures. This study aims to integrate Photogrammetry into the study of iconometry to improve the documentation of the sculptures and minimise the margin of error that anthropometric tools and manual documentation unintentionally but often record. To fulfil the aforementioned objective, a sample of sculptures from six temples of the Hoysala dynasty (10th c. CE - 13th c. CE) were shortlisted. Extensive fieldwork was conducted to document the sculptures using high-resolution, scaled photography, and the images were further processed in the IIT Gandhinagar’s Earth Sciences Department Lab using Agisoft Metashape software’s photogrammetric processing. The 3D models of the shortlisted sculptures were generated through the software, and measurements were extracted from those models for further iconometric analysis. This approach could provide accuracy to the measurements of the sculptures with minimal to zero margin of error, which subsequently can be extremely significant while analysing the iconometry of the sculptures.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "title": "Commercial high alumina crucibles for melting alkali and alkaline earth metal salt mixtures to replicate ancient glass production",
    "section": "",
    "text": "We investigate the chemical refractoriness of high alumina (60-70 wt% Al2O3) crucibles rich in mullite and corundum intended for melting alkali and alkaline earth metal salts. These salts and salt mixtures produce chemically aggressive and low viscosity melts capable of dissolving quartz and crucible walls alike. These interactions are significant for understanding ancient glassmaking processes, as they were used as fluxes to lower the melting temperature of silica, thus being vital components in ancient glass making. The study evaluates the reactivity and interactions of various salts and salt mixtures with an emphasis on their effects on the crucible’s structural integrity and potential seeping through ceramic porosity or even overboiling. Common salts are used to simulate ancient fluxes which were natural mixtures of sodium carbonate and sodium chloride, potassium carbonate, calcium carbonate and sulfate, among others. Various mixtures were tested under controlled laboratory conditions and the results used to outline a detailed protocol for safety precautions necessary when experimenting with these aggressive melts. This study provides a critical assessment on the advantages and disadvantages of using commercially available crucibles and salt raw materials for replicating ancient glassmaking processes. Furthermore, it lays the foundation for the understanding of the reactions between (natural) flux mixtures and the silica source (sand or powdered quartz) during plant-ash glassmaking.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The study assesses the palaeoenvironmental significance of coastal and shallow submarine deposits through the detailed characterisation and absolute dating of beachrock. The physicochemical composition of beachrock deposits provides valuable insights into the sediment types present during beachrock formation over time. The dating technique used was optically stimulated luminescence (OSL). Established analytical techniques, including X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (WD-XRF), and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), were employed for rigorous characterisation of the morphology, as well as qualitative and quantitative mineralogical and elemental composition of the selected samples. Beachrock mapping and sampling were conducted at selected sites along the c.a. 20-km length coastal front of Southeastern Lasithi, Crete, Greece, specifically at Gra Lygia, Ierapetra, Koutsounari, and Ferma sites. The comprehensive characterisation and dating of the samples contributed to refining the chronological context of the beachrock phases in the studied areas (partially presented in previous studies) and facilitated a re-examination of the (micro)environmental conditions, such as the processes involved in beachrock formation and regional trends in past sea level dynamics during the Upper Holocene. Consequently, this first in-depth integrated approach to this area will provide insights into the environmental processes shaping the broader archaeological landscape and illuminate the dynamic interactions between human societies and coastal environments.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "title": "Experimental clay processing and archaeometric analysis to determine the provenance of fine-ware ceramics from the Early Middle Ages in north-western Tuscany (Italy): preliminary results",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The goal of this research is to create a comparative catalogue of raw materials and clays from the northern Tuscany region (Italy) used in fine wares, which will serve as a reference database for determining the provenance of archaeological fine wares. Coarse-ware ceramics are generally easier to trace back to their place of origin compared to fine wares, as the latter contain less petrographic information. To address this challenge, a systematic clay sampling campaign was conducted, collecting samples from outcrops near well-known production centers in the north-western Tuscany. This paper presents the clay processing workflow and preliminary results from XRF and XRD analyses of the raw materials. A multi-analytical approach will be further adopted, involving the study of experimental briquettes fired at various temperature ranges using optical microscopy (OM) to complement the minero-petrographic analysis. Additionally, cathodoluminescence on thin sections will be performed at the Archéosciences Laboratory of the University of Bordeaux Montaigne. This catalogue is part of a broader project aimed at reconstructing the sets of vessels used between the 7th and 10th centuries AD in north Tuscany, as well as understanding the trading dynamics of that period. Determining the provenance and distribution of these ceramics is crucial, as the movement of archaeological ceramics from their production centers to their find spots is related to various human activities such as trade, exchange, and mobility. Therefore, identifying the origins of both coarse-wares and fine-wares can provide significant insights into historical trade patterns.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "title": "Trace element influence on phytolith dissolution and preservation: Investigating the role of strontium and barium",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Several vascular plants produce silicate, calcium carbonate, and calcium oxalate phases in inorganic components of the plants known as phytoliths (SiO2.nH2O), through biomineralisation. Additionally, smaller amounts of strontium oxalate, strontium sulphate, and barium sulphate phases, among others, have been reported in various plants. Although phytolith analysis is an internationally emerging field, recent studies on phytoliths have not emphasised the extent to which the presence of trace chemical elements affects the dissolution of biogenic silicon and, consequently, the preservation of microscopic phytoliths in geoarchaeological contexts. Toward this end, this project investigates the dissolution behaviour of phytoliths (extracted from fresh wheat cultivated in Greece and Cyprus) in relation to variations of pH, temperature, and time through long-term batch laboratory experiments. Specifically, the mobility of strontium (Sr) and barium (Ba) was studied using ICP-MS, with data processed using MATLAB software. The Sr and Ba displayed almost identical behaviour with a very rapid initial elemental release predominantly within the first five days of the leaching experiment. For the high-resolution characterisation of phytolith morphology, mineralogy, and chemistry, a variety of complementary analytical techniques were employed, including OLM, SEM/EDS, XRD, FTIR, ED-XRF, CHNS and TGA-DTGA. Strontium was detected in some EDS spectra, and strontianite (SrCO3) and/or celestite (SrSO4) were identified in the XRD traces. In this study, Ba-minerals were not identified in the phytoliths; the release of Ba along with Sr during the leaching experiments, suggests that Ba may participate in the crystal lattice of strontium carbonate and/or sulphate mineral, substituting for Sr.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "title": "Non-invasive material analysis of Egyptian Shabtis by XRF, Raman spectroscopy and CT Scanning",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In ancient Egyptian culture, shabtis were sets of figurines in the form of mummies made of faience, stone, or wood traditionally deposited inside tombs. According to the Pharaonic funerary beliefs, these figurines acted as magical substitutes for the deceased when the gods called him (or her) to undertake menial tasks in the afterlife. Studying the production process of faience shabtis in addition to their design and engraved inscriptions can provide valuable information. The mineral phase characterization of shabtis kept in museum collections has relied on traditional gemological methods based on visual observations, which are rather inconclusive or too generic and are hindered from the glazed surface of many shabtis. The uniqueness and historical value of these cultural-heritage objects make sampling prohibitive, leading to the growing popularity of non-destructive and non-invasive analytical techniques that are sensitive to both chemistry and crystal structure. Raman spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy and computed tomography (CT) scanning are such non-destructive analytical methods that have been successfully applied for the determination of structure, elemental composition, firing conditions and hidden subsurface structures of painted and enamelled objects. In this study, selected faience shabtis from the collection of the Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg (MKG) were studied by XRF, Raman spectroscopy, and CT Scanning. We show that the combination of these techniques can (i) determine the major, minor, and trace element composition within each mineral phase, (ii) identify the glazing techniques used to produce shabtis, and (iii) reveal structural characteristics of the glaze and subsurface layers.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "title": "Phytolith analysis for the investigation of plant exploitation in Bronze Age Cyprus",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The transition of Middle to Late Bronze Age in Cyprus is a significant turning point for the formation and the gradual emergence of more specialized and complex societies. The archaeological research has put emphasis on the study of metallurgy and the long- distance maritime trade for the investigation of the development of this social complexity while aspects such as agricultural intensification and subsistence practices have been neglected. This also could be the result of the limited recovery of archaeobotanical macro- remains from Cypriot Bronze Age sites due to depositional restrictions. This paper aims to contribute on the current research regarding the agricultural practices and the plant exploitation based on the analysis of phytoliths from two sites, Erimi-Laonin tou Porakou and Erimi-Pitharka. Erimi- Laonin tou Porakou is a Middle Bronze Age site consisted of a habitational area, a textile workshop, circular wall and funerary area. On the other hand, Erimi-Pitharka is a Late Bronze Age site, located in close distance south of Erimi-Laonin tou Porakou, includes a building complex related to storage and industrial activities associated to agricultural production. Phytolith analysis reveals a wide range of plant related practices providing comparative data about the agricultural economy at a regional level diachronically.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "title": "The interaction between Persian Gulf and Indian Peninsular during the middle-late Islamic Period: Compositional evidence for the high-alumina glass bangles discovered from coastal sites of Qatar and U.A.E.",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Glass and ceramic artifacts were widely distributed along the trade routes between the East and West during significant periods of trade and cultural exchange, reflecting interactions from manufacturing regions to consuming societies. In the Persian Gulf region, a considerable quantity of ceramic sherds and glass ornaments and vessel fragments have been excavated from coastal town sites in the U.A.E. (14th-16th century CE) and Northern Qatar (18th-20th century CE). Archaeological assemblages indicate that glass bangles were a common accessory during the mid-late Islamic period. Compositional analysis of these representative glass bangles, conducted by LA-ICP-MS and SEM-EDS, revealed several bangles with high alumina content, distinguishing them from the predominant plant ash soda-lime-silica glass of the Islamic period. These unique samples were further classified into two subgroups based on their mineral and plant ash flux compositions. This study aims to identify the possible provenances of these high-Al subgroups relevant to different areas of the Indian Peninsula in terms of major and trace elements of the glasses, and also to illustrate a broad distribution landscape of high-alumina glass spanning South Asia, West Asia, the Levant, and even China. Additionally, the manufacturing techniques of polychrome bangles will be discussed in conjunction with micro-CT analysis results.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper presents the results of analysis of painted plaster from Stymphalos in the north east Peloponnese. Excavations at the lower town site uncovered two large elite residences, one of which had a large quantity of surviving wall plaster in moulded stucco panels. Both the three-dimensional stucco style and the faux-marble painted effect are representative of the Hellenistic Masonry style of wall plaster, which to date has only been discovered in limited quantities. In general, there have been few discoveries of Hellenistic domestic painted plaster in Greece, with the majority of material from this period belonging to funerary contexts. This research employs a multianalytical approach in the identification of materials, providing an important contribution to the understanding of pigments used in domestic decoration in the Hellenistic period.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "title": "Shallow offshore archaeological Prospection in ancient Olous, Crete",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Archaeological prospection in aquatic sites presents unique challenges compared to land surveys. Until recently, most research efforts were focused on adapting instrumentation and processing methods for mapping cultural objects in deep marine environment. However, the implementation of similar methods in ultra-shallow coastal areas poses specific difficulties due to the challenging environmental context. Preserving cultural layers in these areas is crucial due to factors like rising sea levels, coastal erosion and human activity, which may threaten cultural heritage integrity. Thus, the effective documentation of coastal and ultra-shallow sites requires the integration of modified methodological approaches, both in terms of instrumentation and processing algorithms. The sunken city of Ancient Olous, in modern Elounda, Crete, Greece, holds significant archaeological importance, with evidence of inhabitation since the Archaic period. Offshore geophysical prospection utilizing three-dimensional (3-D) Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) successfully mapped a submerged fortress wall and identified potential archaeological targets buried below the seabed. The results highlight the importance of shallow offshore marine geophysics in archaeological research, offering new tools for coastal zone exploration and integration with land sites underscoring at the same time the importance of this evolving field. By addressing challenges unique to coastal areas, such as dynamic underwater conditions and limited visibility, shallow offshore geophysical prospection can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of maritime archaeology. Further development of the methodological flowcharts and integration into archaeological projects, promises to enhance the study and preservation of submerged cultural heritage worldwide.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

During her PhD studies, she was fully embedded in the field team, designing recovery protocols, supervising recovery in the field, and analysing resulting material, thereby becoming an expert in the flora of the Aegean and the current models of the economy and social organization of the first millennium BCE.\nThroughout her PhD studies she was also awarded two Erasmus+ Programs; one took place in 2018, in the School of Archaeology of the University of Oxford and the second in 2021 in the Humana, IMF-SCIC Institute, in Barcelona. Both Erasmus programs focused on microbotanical studies and specifically the analysis of starch granules retrieved from the interior of ceramic pots, in order to reconstruct cooking and consumption patterns in the 1st millennium BCE in Greece. She has also held the British School of Athens Centenary Bursary in order to conduct similar research in Oxford related to the Keros research and excavation project of the University of Cambridge (2019).\nIn MedisFood, Kyriaki holds a Post-Doctorate position where she explores the long durée of plant choices of the 3rd/2nd millennium BCE, the varieties of grapes and olives exploited in the biggest islands of the Eastern Mediterranean, Crete and Cyprus, and addresses key questions related to the rise of complex societies in both islands. The simultaneous analysis of both islands allows not only the understanding of the unique social and agricultural structures of each island, but also the definition of patterns and tendencies that may have appeared at the same time on both regions and which may reflect adaptations, influences and ultimately connections with other areas, or even directly between Crete and Cyprus."

As such, we attempt to take into account the varied backgrounds and situations of researchers coming from diverse scientific communities and countries.

    "section": "The journey",
    "text": "The journey\nThe idea for the workshop began in 2016 in a discussion about why so few ECRs are joining the German archaeological sciences conference “Archäometrie & Denkmalpflege” (Archaeometry & preservation of historic monuments). Besides the psychological barrier of delivering the first conference presentation in front of very distinguished researchers, it was realised that the archaeological sciences are often dispersed among many different institutes and work groups, making it very difficult for ECRs to get in contact with peers.\nSince the first workshop in Frankfurt in 2017, all YRA workshops stayed true to the original idea. While originally aiming for the German community, the workshops soon became orientated towards an international audience with about 50% of the participants in the second edition being internationals. Already in 2019, it became an international workshop series organised at an institution outside of Germany for the first time. The latest step was to purposefully keep the hybrid format to become more inclusive to colleagues unable to attend the workshop in person while keeping the benefits of in-person meetings for networking.\nWith every new edition, the structures for YRA have become more and more professionalised. Beginning with the processing of abstracts and registration in 2019, this was followed by the logo, mail address, and a first webpage in 2022, the last of which resulted in this webpage and the mailing list in 2023. Consequently, workload shifted more and more towards the local organisation while templates now exist for most other tasks. This, and the active support from previous organisers whenever needed, makes the YRA workshops particularly suited to gather first experiences as workshop organiser. This is what keeps YRA true to its motto: for ECRs by ECRs.\nSo, what’s new? Starting in 2024, the YRA will organise a seminar series with lectures from fellow ECRs on a wide range of topics in archaeological science that are featured in the workshops.\nIf you are interested in organising the next workshop or have ideas for additional events, please get in touch via mail."

Without a doubt, the biggest challenge was to create a logo that represents the huge breadth of disciplines working together in the archaeological sciences and represents the target group. Given the interdisciplinary ethos of the YRA workshops, it was decided that an abstract logo would be the most suitable.\nThe logo writes “YRA” embedded in a spectra-like line with each letter having a different colour and the grey coloured parts as connecting lines. The trowel-shaped arrows outline the negative space (“hole”) of the letters R and A and are inspired by the markers for characteristic peaks. The colours do not have a special meaning. They were chosen because this combination is colour-blind friendly and pleasing to the eyes of the persons involved in the design process."

    "title": "Mineralogical and petrographic study of tuyères from Pongsolo (Lekie, Central Cameroon)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Pongsolo is located in the Lekie Division of Central Cameroon. Archaeological studies have confirmed the presence of iron smelting activities at this site between the 15th and 16th century AD. Eight fragments of tuyères from Pongsolo were analysed by X-ray diffraction and polarised optical microscopy to determine their mineralogy, and deduce their firing temperature and the iron smelting temperature. Five tuyères are reddish with some black parts on their surface, whereas the three others are black and covered with a layer of slag. X-ray diffraction revealed three mineralogical groups of samples: The first group (2 samples) contained quartz, muscovite and kaolinite. The second group (3 samples) contained muscovite and quartz and the third group (3 samples) contained mullite and quartz. The results of polarised optical microscopy agree with the mineralogical groups. The first group is characterised by a reddish matrix with an abundance of mica flakes (biotite and muscovite), indicating a firing temperature range below 600 °C due to the presence of kaolinite. The second group has a dark matrix with few mica flakes, indicating a temperature range of 600 to 900 °C. The third group is characterised by a vitrified matrix, indicating a firing temperature above 1000 °C. The variation of the mineralogy and the firing temperature of the tuyères can be explained by their different position in the furnace. The presence of mullite, vitrification, quartz and a layer of slag in the third group indicated an iron smelting temperature between 1000 and 1300°C.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "title": "Fuelling ancient Idalion: Charcoal analysis and insights into 1st millennium BCE Cyprus",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The site of ancient Idalion lies in the centre of the island of Cyprus around 20km southeast of modern-day Nicosia. The site is of vital importance as it is closely situated to the copper mining zone in the eastern foothills of Troodos mountains, and the fertile valley of the Yiallias River. The earliest settlement of the site dates to the 13th to 12th century BCE, while during the excavations conducted by the Department of Antiquities of Cyprus, a Phoenician administrative centre was identified dating to the 4th century BCE. Although, archaeobotanical studies are fundamental in exploring the relationship between communities and the natural environment, bringing forward various characteristics of everyday life in ancient societies, research centring on wood charcoal during the 1st millennium BCE Cyprus have been limited. Thus, this paper seeks to fill this gap by investigating the intricate relations between humans and their natural environment through the application of wood charcoal analysis. This paper also aims to emphasize the key role of archaeobotanical studies in supplementing our understanding of ancient societies by focusing on key aspects such as timber procurement and fuel economy. Simultaneously, it seeks to understand the intricacies of daily life at ancient Idalion.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Cuneiform represents the earliest form of writing developed by the Sumerians in Mesopotamia in the 2nd half of the 4th millennium BCE. From the middle of the 3rd millennium BCE, people wrote legal documents and sent many letters. To protect the tablets and ensure confidentiality, tablets were encased in clay envelopes. These envelopes featured the names of the sender, the seal imprint using cylinder seals, and the name(s) of the addressee(s). Reading the message required breaking the envelope, however, some letters never reached their recipient and remained within their clay envelopes for thousands of years. The study of enveloped clay tablets serves as an important reminder that unopened heritage artifacts conceal the narratives of their past within both their textual contents and structural integrity. As such, this research aims to explore the application of non-destructive techniques on enveloped clay tablets. In this contribution we present our efforts in developing a portable high-resolution X-ray tomographic scanner, designed in collaboration with the cluster of excellence at Universität Hamburg ‘Understanding Written Artifacts’ and Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron. The X-ray scanner can be assembled and dismantled for use in museums and collections. This newly developed device was recently used for the very first time at the Louvre Museum, yielding excellent tomographic data on twelve contracts and administrative texts from the end of the 3rd and the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE. This innovative system facilitates comprehensive non-destructive measurement of enveloped tablets, covering the entire measurement process from data acquisition to on-site 3D visualization.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Clay processing can deeply affect the characteristic of a base clay, having important effect on both provenance studies and technological issues in ceramic examinations. Decantation is one of those clay processing techniques that has been used for cleaning the clay from the impurities (coarser fraction) found in the sediment. The influence of this processing is assessed experimentally by delving into the effects it has on a mineralogical, elemental, and microscopic level. Ten clayey materials were sampled from different geographic location in the Mediterranean basin (Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Sudan) to undergo a multianalytical approach before and after they were depurated. X-ray Fluorescence and X-ray Powder Diffraction were used to interpret the mineralogical and chemical changes of the base clay underwent, as well as laser granulometry to establish the changes in terms of grain-size distribution pre and post processing (depuration for sedimentation in calm water). The samples were also fired at 400°C facilitating thin section production enabling microscopic analysis. Digital imaging analysis using the Scanning Electron Microscope with backscattered electron images was crucial for elemental understanding of the clays. Finally, Atterberg limits were measured to explored the impact of decantation on clay plasticity, giving information on changes in mineral type content and organic material. The samples are to be further tested in the close future for isotopic analysis and ICP-MS. By addressing these changes, the study aims to deepen our understanding of clay behavior, therefore helping develop our insights into ceramic production techniques and facilitating provenance studies.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Since coins are generally an officially produced medium, provenance studies of the metal used to produce them can provide important information on the logistical, infrastructural and organizational capacities of central authorities. Thus, it is not surprising that ancient coins have been the subject of a large number of archaeometallurgical studies, in particular involving lead isotopes. The composition of the silver in the coin metal of Roman Imperial denarii has been intensively investigated in recent years by Kevin Butcher and Matthew Ponting. However, the work concentrated primarily on the chemical composition, with a relatively smaller number of isotopic analyses being carried out, and concentrating on specific questions. To complement the investigations of Butcher and Ponting, more than 200 coins from the period 30 BC to AD 240 have been sampled for isotopic analysis in a project based at the German Mining Museum in Bochum. Besides standard lead isotopes, these analyses also included copper and silver isotopes, which were performed in Bochum, at the Frankfurt Isotope and Element Research Center FIERCE, the Laboratoire de Géologie de Lyon, École normale supérieure de Lyon, and in the Institute for Geosciences at the Goethe University Frankfurt. The combination of isotopic analyses of different elements has provided deeper, sometimes surprising insights, qualifying the information provided by lead isotopes alone. This paper will present the first results and interpretation of our analyses, so indicating how a combination of isotopic methods can advance our understanding of the provenance and the methods used to obtain the raw materials.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The topographical and archaeological evidence coming from excavations in Nea Paphos suggests that occupation of the area already began in the Classical times, in other words before the foundation of the city in the late 4th c. BCE. Architectural remains representing this period are scarce, but contexts associated with the pre-urban phase as well as Hellenistic and Roman layers yielded ceramic materials of Classical date. This paper focuses on the Classical tableware pottery retrieved from two excavations in Nea Paphos (Maloutena and the Agora) in order to provide more information on the human activity during the period in question. Samples representing various types of bowls and plates were subjected to mineralogical and elemental analyses. The investigations afforded the reconstruction of the chaîne opératoire and consumption patterns of table wares in south-western Cyprus in the Classical period. The comparison of the studied material with already analyzed Hellenistic table ware from Nea Paphos contributes to the exploration of the local potting tradition as well as how it was impacted by socio-economic and political changes.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "title": "Breaking into the “black box”: The contribution of ethnographic work in decoding Late Cypriot household structures",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Archaeological research frequently places the remains of domestic environments in the epicenter of discourse, aiming to monitor and comprehend the social organization of past societies. Regarding the Late Bronze Age in Cyprus, though, research usually emphasizes on the elite dwellings and practices. While previous research has made significant progress in investigating the social complexity of the Late Cypriot communities, ongoing research is still far from thoroughly understanding the foundations of these societies. For this reason, a bottom-up approach is needed, focusing on the smallest social units, i.e., households. These structures can only be decoded through an in-depth analysis and interpretation of their functions and behaviors, which can be challenging. Nevertheless, as Wilk highlights, only by tracing these functions, ongoing research can break into the “black box” of households. Ethnographic parallels, especially of pre-industrial societies, are invaluable to this process. Although we cannot directly project the social processes of later communities onto the Late Cypriot period, ethnographic parallels shed light on traditional –and at times forgotten– everyday practices. Therefore, this paper attempts to connect Late Cypriot household practices to the ethnographic record, aiming to provide an in-depth understanding of the activities occuring within Late Cypriot habitation units and, thus, their socioeconomic organization.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Lead isotopes are currently the most powerful method for the reconstruction of the raw material provenance of non-ferrous metals. The success of the method relies crucially on the availability of reference data from all potential ore deposits or other suitable materials with a known production location. OXALID was the first open access database for such data, and many more followed since. While they are great resources, data compilation is still a tedious task because these datasets are usually published in a static format (e.g., as supporting information of articles) and the authors follow their own approaches in the description of the data. The result is datasets that are difficult to combine but to a large extent based on the same pool of publications. To overcome this situation, TerraLID builds upon the prototype GlobaLID but aims to significantly enhance its functionalities towards a digital research data infrastructure that allows the publication, compilation and interpretation of lead isotope data for a large variety of archaeological and geological materials. It aims to implement the FAIR data principles in a community-driven process to ensure that the research infrastructure and metadata are developed close to the needs of the community. The TerraLID team is open, meaning that it welcomes all kinds of contributions from the community and provides many opportunities to get involved in the development process. This contribution will highlight some of these opportunities and presents examples of how this process shaped the design of TerraLID.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The contribution of Environmental studies for understanding the nature of the agrarian economy in the Late Bronze Age Aegean has been widely neglected by previous research. Although archaeobotanical remains were recovered from the first excavations at Aegean sites during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, little attention has been paid to their systematic retrieval and study, since previous research was heavily based on the textual Linear B evidence. Today, although essential research steps have been done, unfortunately, many Aegean archaeologists still consider the archaeobotanical remains as a “second line of evidence”. To contribute to this gap in evidence and to answer basic inquiries on the nature of Mycenaean agrarian economy, systematic archaeobotanical sampling has been applied in Iklaina, in Messenia, Greece. Previous research on the site attests uninterrupted habitation from the LH I to LH III periods. The material that is going to be presented has been retrieved from three individual units, Building NE-A, Building P and Building Z, all of which are dated to the palatial period. Basic inquiries that are at the core of this research are the nature of the agrarian economy at the site (diversified and/or specialized farming) and to distinguish patterns of production before and after the incorporation of Iklaina in the administrative network of Pylos.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Throughout history, the Senne river has always been an important landmark for Brussels. In the past, the river served multiple functions. It was essential for providing food and water, for waste disposal, navigation and transport. Infrastructures such as mills, breweries, fortifications and fishponds could be found along its banks. The course of the river Senne and its side branches has changed drastically across history. As the landscape and the city developed, the river’s flow was adapted in natural and artificial ways. Today, many questions remain unanswered concerning the evolution of the Senneriver valley, and the general human-environment interactions across history. Recent (geo)archaeological research conducted under the auspices of urban.brussels, the Brussels Regional Administration in charge of the archaeological heritage, has shown the tremendous archaeological potential of the river valley to reach a renewed understanding of the development of the Senne and its branches. Therefore, the RETS project aims to provide a synthesis of the archaeological, environmental and historical data from the Senne valley within the historical center of Brussels, starting from the Holocene until the 19th century. The research will generate maps and 3D-models which will be integrated in the publicly accessible regional cartographic platform BruGIS. These newly developed tools will as such contribute to an optimal management of the archaeological heritage in the research area.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The site of Zeytinli Bahçe Höyük, located near Birecik (Urfa province, Turkey), provides a valuable testimony to the complex cultural history of the Middle Euphrates Valley over several millennia. Its strategic position and extensive stratigraphic sequence, spanning from the 4th millennium BC to the late Byzantine/medieval period, make it an excellent observatory for studying the numerous changes that have affected southeastern Anatolia and northern Mesopotamia over time. At the YRA 2024 Conference, preliminary results of petrographic analyses conducted using polarized light microscopy on a selection of ceramic artifacts from the Late Chalcolithic 3-5 levels and the Early Bronze Age I (from the early 4th millennium BC to the early 3rd millennium BC) of Zeytinli Bahçe will be presented. The collected data allow us to trace the evolution of craft practices related to the site’s ceramic production, from the origin of raw materials to the manufacturing techniques of the vessels. Through this analysis, it has been possible to identify the persistence of some traditions in the manufacture and use of the vessels, as well as modifications linked to the socio-economic and cultural transformations within the communities that inhabited Zeytinli Bahçe. These data contribute to the debate on the cultural and social transformations that characterized Greater Mesopotamia in the 4th millennium BC, with a particular focus on the northward expansion of Uruk culture groups, aiming to clarify the impact and scope of external cultural influences, such as that of the Uruk culture, on local traditions.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "text": "Voss. Gr. Q. 25 (University Library of Leiden) and Cod. in scrin. 145 (State and University Library of Hamburg), are two paper codices, probably produced in Venice in the late 15th century C.E. (ca. 1480-1498). Despite the absence of colophons in the manuscripts, their distinct palaeographical characteristics strongly suggest that they were penned by the hand of Ioannes Rhosos, a renowned professional calligrapher from the Greek island of Crete, who was copying manuscripts for prominent commissioners in Italy during the second half of the 15th century. This paper will a) present the preliminary results of the multi-analytical examination of the black and red inks, that were used by Rhosos in the copying of the two manuscripts and b) provide an initial comparison of the types and compositions of these inks between the two codices. The in-depth analysis and comparison of the inks of the two case studies contribute to the understanding of the types of inks produced and used in the Veneto region by the late 15th century. Equally important, the results obtained in this research constitute a first step towards profiling the working process of a Renaissance important calligrapher in terms of the writing substances he employed. The analysis for this study was performed using non-invasive and non-destructive analytical techniques, such as Ultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) reflectography, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Visible (VIS) spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

The Stoicani-Aldeni aspect was defined as a “mixed aspect” or “synthesis facies” between the Gumelnița and the Pre-Cucuteni/Cucuteni civilizations, initially on the basis of archaeological excavations at Stoicani-Cetățuia (south-east Romania, Galați County) and Aldeni- Gurguiul Balaurului. This presentation will discuss the results obtained on a batch of Chalcolithic pottery from Eastern and South-East of Romania (ca. 4600-4000 cal BC).

    "section": "",
    "text": "During the period of Roman Influence (1st-3rd century AD), in Poland existed three large metallurgical centers of the Przeworsk culture: Świętokrzyskie, Silesian and Masovian. These centers were famous for their large-scale iron production. The ore was fired in clay furnaces resembling chimneys, which were filled with coal and ore in layers. In the Świętokrzyskie Mountains, experimental research reconstructing the iron smelting process has been taking place since the 1950s. Experimental research was carried out there, including physico-chemical research, to help analyze the iron smelting process at the atomic level. In Masovia, experiments focused primarily on the design aspects of the furnace chimney. This project focuses on the chemical-physical composition of bog iron ore. The ore will be tested for its elemental composition. The results will be compared with the ore found at mining sites from the 2nd century AD. The analysis will show whether there are differences in the elemental composition of the iron age and modern ore and how it affects the experimental results.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Metallurgy is always thought to have played a vital role in the development of the Early Bronze Age Aegean societies, being connected to economic development and social complexity. This paper is an overview of the archaeometallurgical study of remains from Early Bronze Age sites located on southern Sifnos, Skali, Kasela and Akrotiraki. The metallurgical remains, lead and copper slag, litharge and furnace wall fragments have been studied using Optical Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). Skali is a copper smelting site, where primary and secondary copper minerals, probably local, were smelted in non-perforated furnaces. At Kasela, the only currently known lead smelting site in the Early Bronze Age Aegean, local argentiferous lead ore was smelted within perforated furnaces. Part of the activities conducted within the settlement of Akrotiraki are related to lead-silver production. The slag from Akrotiraki derives either from smelting of argentiferous lead ore like Kasela, or a refining process of possibly the metal produced at Kasela. The litharge fragments are litharge impregnated hearth linings related to cupellation, whilst silver metal has been detected in some of the samples. Therefore, on southern Sifnos in a radius of approximately 500m the two main stages of the lead-silver production, smelting and cupellation, as well as the primary production of copper are present, rendering it the only area within the Early Bronze Age Aegean that all the above stages of metallurgical production co-exist.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

The shards were discovered in the defensive ditch of the enclosure I, during the research excavation the took place in 2019 at the mega-fort of Sântana “Cetatea Veche”, situated in the Lower Mureş basin. While analysing the pottery shards, we are using both XRDP and the polarizing microscope methods to define the firing temperatures and the provenance of the raw material.

    "text": "This work presents the current results of the archaeometric study carried out on 121 samples of jars from the site of Qatna (Tell Mishrifeh, central Syria), dated from the early Bronze age to the Iron age. The samples were characterized in terms of mineral composition by X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD), petro-fabric by optical microscopy, chemical composition by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and the results were then combined with the typological features (shapes). This diachronic research enabled the identification of a change in the petro-fabric from the Early Bronze Age to the Iron Age, which can be interpreted in terms of modifications in the production recipe, firing, and production techniques of the jars. As the ceramic material here analyzed corresponds to the first in central Syria to be stratigraphically excavated and dated in absolute terms, this provides a significant step into deciphering the history of this important site. This research highlights the possibility of application of archaeometric data to understand the manufacturing techniques and provenance of this ceramic material, while also enabling a reconstruction of circulation patterns of pottery between Bronze and Iron Age Syria.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

    "text": "Delos, located in the Cyclades (Greece), was Rome’s ‘duty free’ hub in the Late Hellenistic period (166/7-89/69 BCE). The central position of the island in Mediterranean trade is reflected in the abundance and variety of ceramic materials recovered during excavations. Among them are braziers–i.e. portable cooking devices. The vast number of braziers found on the island led some scholars to assume that at least some of them were made locally. In order to test this assumption all fragments of braziers unearthed in three temples of Sarapis on Delos were examined macroscopically and 22 samples were analysed with thin section petrography and wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence. The results revealed the presence of six different fabrics, four of which are compatible with the geology of Cycladic islands located in the vicinity of Delos. All of the ‘local’ braziers have the same general morphological characteristics with subtle differences. This ‘Cycladic’ type is stylistically distinct from the ‘imported’ braziers studied, which are more compatible with East Aegean geology.\n   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."

This is particularly the case for the rural economy, despite its evident importance to cultural developments within neighbouring regions. A small but growing body of scholarship is beginning to rectify this through bioarchaeological research aimed at reconstructing systems of farming and land use in the past. Focusing on the Aegean region of western Anatolia, I outline how these studies have transformed our understanding of agrarian lifeways and can shed new light on the dramatic cultural developments that can be traced across the Neolithic and Bronze Age. I go on to assess the implications of this regional trajectory for broader developments across the Aegean."

Indeed, in Taiwan and the Philippines, there is no mention of a Bronze and Iron Age but of a Metal Age (or directly an Iron Age) since iron, copper-based, glass and precious metal technologies seem to appear together in archaeological context. The first signs of metallurgy in the island contexts of Taiwan and the Philippines appear to have followed similar patterns; no Bronze Age, no sign of primary production, only secondary production and where maritime exchange is a central issue in the development of these technologies. Metallurgy would probably have reached the islands through maritime contacts with mainland Southeast Asia, where metallurgical practices took place earlier (11-13th BC) and maritime contacts have been known since the Neolithic period, notably through nephrite objects. Current evidence seems to support that Taiwan and the Philippines did not have any primary production of copper during the Metal Age but still needs to be proved by future studies. It has been proposed that raw materials and some finish objects were imported. However, secondary production activities are attested with molds, both in Taiwan and the Philippines.\nCopper and its alloys are one of the materials thought to come from the maritime interactions and thus represent an important proxy to study the movements of goods/communities/technologies between the different areas around the South China Sea. Regarding the similarities observed between Taiwan and the Philippines as well as the ancient exchanges attested between the two areas, the current project aims to collect data in order to start discussing the copper-based traditions and the potential exchange networks. We also hope that the data can contribute to understand the origin, timing and development of copper-based metallurgy in Taiwan and the Philippines and its link to other regions for the acquisition of raw materials/finish objects. Around 50 scientific samples, mainly in Taiwan so far, have been collected to be studied following an archaeometric approach (Optical Microscopy, SEM-EDS and ongoing lead isotope analyses). In Taiwan, the current results show that artefacts are diverse, both in terms of their forms (such as bells, vessels, knife handles, Chinese coins, unidentified fragments) and composition (alloys), including bronze, leaded-bronze, high-tin bronze, unalloyed copper, leaded copper and brass. Some artefacts result probably from oversea exports. In Taiwan, differences can also be observed between sites, probably as a result of the different metallurgical practices identified during the excavations, such as secondary production activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 1st – Alkiviadis Sideridis (University of Athens, Greece)\n\n\n\n\n\nTime: 8:00 am (UTC)\nTitle: Tinos’ lost ancient serpentinite quarry (Cyclades, Greece): an interdisciplinary approach\nKeywords: Stone analysis; Serpentinite; Cyclades Greece; Ancient quarry\nAbstract: The study of marble and coloured-stone production centres of antiquity carries a significant role in the scientific community, being a subject where natural and archaeological sciences may interweave, aiming to decipher quarrying methods, trade and the unique geological fingerprint of the stones. Contemporary quarrying activity on Tinos Island, Greece, is focused on ophicalcites (metasomatic rock consisting of serpentine and carbonates), however, the studied ancient quarry of Ag. Georgios Ras (Ras serpentinite) consist of a distinctive serpentinite, with no carbonate participation when compared to the neighbouring ophicalcite. Ras serpentinite was quarried from two small-scale open pits demonstrating tool marks, grooves, as well as holes for inserting wedges. The serpentinite consists of, macroscopically and mineralogically, two serpentine varieties, a dark green demonstrating massive texture and a light green forming a network of fibrous serpentine. Research efforts on serpentinite provenance are limited and lack information and data when compared to the study of white marble. This study aims to enrich the present database using a variety of techniques, including XRD, LA-ICP-MS and physicomechanical tests to determine the geochemistry, geotectonic environment of formation and strength characteristics of the Ras serpentinite. The geological study is framed, in an interdisciplinary approach, by archaeological and lichenometrical data and observation to further shed light upon the newly explored Ras serpentinite quarry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 10th – Thorsten Jakobitsch (Austrian Archaeological Institute, Austria)\n\n\n\n\n\nTime: 8:00 am (UTC)\nTitle: Plant and insect remains as indicators for waterlogged dung layers – The example of the Neolithic lakeshore settlement Mooswinkel in the Austrian Alps\nKeywords: Stable manure; Pile dwelling; Archaeobotany; Archaeoentomology; Late Neolithic\nAbstract: Stable manure preserves well in waterlogged archaeological sediments. The organic refuse provides a wealth of information about the site’s economy, forest resources, and impact on the environment. However, the recognition of middens and manure in sediment layers is not always straightforward. In the case study of the Late Neolithic pile dwelling Mooswinkel at the lake Mondsee in Austria, dung, botanical macro- and microremains, as well as invertebrates identified the sediment as stable manure from goat, sheep and cattle farming. Furthermore, the season of the layer formation could be recognized. Materials investigated included pollen, bryophytes, plant fruits and seeds, leaves, branches and bud scales of woody plants, as well as insect remains. In addition, plant microremains in dung were analysed. The results of this multi-material study show that leaf hay and grass hay were used as fodder during the winter season. The impact of fodder acquisition and pasturing on the forest could be reconstructed, showing the formation of a mosaic landscape of natural and semi-natural habitats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 10th – Madison McCartin (University of California, Davis, USA)\n\n\n\n\n\nTime: 2:00 pm (UTC)\nTitle: Biomolecular insights into Magdalenian ungulates from Petersfels (Hegau Jura, southwestern Germany) via ZooMS and stable isotope analysis\nKeywords: Magdalenian; ZooMS; Stable isotopes; Zooarchaeology; Paleoenvironment; Ungulates\nAbstract: After the Last Glacial Maximum, ameliorating climates facilitated the recolonization of Central Europe by human and animal groups. Petersfels, situated in the Hegau Jura of southwestern Germany, evidences the later stages of this repopulation, dating to ~16-14 ka cal BP. Over the past hundred years, numerous excavations at the site have revealed an exceptional record of Magdalenian subsistence including abundant lithic and osseous material, personal ornaments, engravings, and female figurines. Faunal remains are particularly relevant, as they archive information on human and animal lifeways as well as the broader post-LGM environmental context. However, despite this great potential, little is known about the paleoecological context of the site or the broader Hegau Jura. Here, we present new biomolecular analyses of the Petersfels faunal assemblage, which help to illuminate the paleoecology of the region. Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS) was applied to identify rare taxa and to differentiate between closely related species. We also conducted stable isotope analyses of carbon (δ13C) and oxygen (δ18O) from serially sampled equid and bovid tooth enamel carbonate. The latter contributes to our understanding of local paleoecology during the Magdalenian and the status of human and animal communities during post-LGM climatic change. More broadly, this work shows how heritage collections like Petersfels are still immensely valuable, especially with the application of modern biomolecular techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 11th– Veronica Occari (University College London, UK)\n\n\n\n\n\nTime: 12:00 pm (UTC)\nTitle: The technology of polychrome glazed ceramics in Ifriqiya: new data from the Medjerda Valley\nCo-authors: H. Möller, C. Fenwick, P. Quinn, I.C. Freestone, M. Chaouali, P. von Rummel\nKeywords: Ifriqiya; Medieval glazed ceramics; Pottery technology; Petrography; Compositional analyses\nAbstract: Ifriqiya (roughly Tunisia and eastern Algeria) is believed to have played a significant role in the diffusion of ceramic glazed technologies into other regions of the Western Mediterranean. However, due to limited analysis on North African glazed ceramics, its role in technology transfer remains poorly understood. This paper uses petrographic, SEM-EDS and LA-ICP-MS analyses to understand the technology employed in the production of Tunisian ceramics through the study of polychrome glazed ceramics from medieval settlements at the sites of Chimtou (ancient Simitthus) and Bulla Regia, Tunisia, dated to the late ninth-twelfth century. The results provide new insights on workshops practices, on the origin of the ceramics and on regional inland exchange networks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 10th – Sibylle Manya (National Centre for Research and Restoration in French Museums, France)\n\n\n\n\n\nTime: 3:00 pm (UTC)\nTitle: Chrysocolla at high temperatures: understanding Pre-Hispanic metallurgy through Collahuasi slag analysis (Tarapaca, Chile)\nCo-authors: B. Mille, V. Figueroa Larre, T. Bataille, L. Le Pollès, J.-B. d’Espinose de Lacaillerie\nKeywords: Chrysocolla characterization; Thermal analysis; Pre-Hispanic copper metallurgy\nAbstract: Ujina-Collahuasi is an archaeological site located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, renowned as a major center for copper production during the pre-Inca and Inca periods. Pre-Hispanic metallurgists utilized bench-shaped granodiorite furnaces to smelt ore, leveraging the wind to achieve high temperatures and extract copper in the form of metallic beads. The resulting slag, rich in silicon, exhibits various mineralogical phases, notably yellow-green or yellow-orange phases that are of particular interest. These phases, rich in copper and silicon, may be attributed to the prevalence of chrysocolla among the ores used.\nThis study focuses on a characterization of chrysocolla, a copper silicate with an amorphous and controversial structure. At ambient temperature, several analytical techniques (PIXE, SEM-EDS, and solid-state NMR) were employed to overcome challenges related to its variable chemical composition and disordered crystalline structure. At high temperatures, the thermal decomposition of chrysocolla was investigated by heating several samples to different temperatures and characterizing them using various techniques (optical microscopy, XRD, IR spectroscopy, SEM-EDS). Additionally, an in-situ study was conducted, providing XRD scans of a sample subjected to increasing temperatures.\nThe results obtained enhance our understanding of the transformation of chrysocolla observed in the pre-Hispanic slag from Collahuasi and the evolution of metallurgical techniques. Previous studies have been supplemented by analyzing slags from excavations in the Ujina 10 sector, including three furnaces dated to different periods. The objective was to identify any changes in copper reduction techniques between the pre-Inca and the Inca occupation."
