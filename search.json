The workshop will once again welcome early career researchers (master, PhD, first postdoc) in archaeological sciences and cultural heritage studies.\nWith this workshop we aim to offer a relaxed atmosphere to encourage interdisciplinary exchange between early career researchers. With a hybrid format, we are happy to welcome participants in person, as well as those online from all around the world, who cannot come to Tübingen. We are pleased to invite you for oral contributions in all kinds of natural sciences about archaeological and anthropological topics. In particular, early career researchers in archaeology, art history, anthropology, biology, chemistry, conservation, cultural heritage, earth science, material science, medicine, physics are welcome to submit an abstract."

    "text": "How to get to Tübingen\nTübingen is a university city in south-western Germany, at the centre of the state Banden-Württemberg. It is located ca. 30 km south of Stuttgart, the state capital.\nYou can easily access Tübingen via direct train from Stuttgart central station (IRE6, MEX12, and MEX18), or via bus lines 828 and X82 from Stuttgart Airport (STR). You can find information about connections with trains and regional buses here. Several long distance bus lines operated by e.g. flixbus stop at Tübingen. With a car you reach Tübingen best via the B27 and B28.\nThe YRA workshop will take place in Hohentübingen Castle, in Tübingen’s historical city centre. Please be aware that the Castle is located on a small but steep hill. Access for persons with reduced mobility is possible but require arrangements in advance regarding e.g. parking. Please contact us if this should be the case, we are happy to make the necessary arrangements for you."

She completed her bachelor (BA) and master (MSc) at Istanbul Technical University (Turkey) in the Department of Geological Engineering. In her PhD project, she investigates clay resources and ancient ceramics from the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age in Cilicia, Southeast Anatolia, Eastern Mediterranean by using several disciplines, such as mineralogy, petrography, geochemistry and field geology. In addition, she is working as a research assistant on several projects funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and hosted at the Competence Center Archaeometry - Baden-Württemberg (CCA-BW).\n\n\n\nBaptiste Solard (Universität Tübingen)  Baptiste completed his Diplôme d’ingénieur chimiste (BSc and MSc equivalent) in Material Sciences at the National Graduate School of Chemistry of Montpellier, France (ENSCM) in November 2019. In October 2021, he successfully finished his master of Archaeological Sciences with specialisation in archaeometry (MSc) at the University of Tübingen (Germany), Department of Geoscience, Institute for Archeological Sciences with a thesis on Atticising Black Gloss ceramics from the 4th century BCE. Since December 2019, he is a research assistant at the Competence Center Archaeometry - Baden-Württemberg (CCA-BW), working in various projects on ancient ceramic technology. In 2023, he will start his PhD at the University of Tübingen on Merovingian pigmented glass production in Switzerland.\n\n\n\nThomas Rose (Goethe-Universität Frankfurt)  Thomas is a coordinator in the NDFI4Earth at Goethe University Frankfurt, PhD student at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and La Sapienza - Universitá di Roma within the MSCA-ITN Project ED-ARCHMAT, and visiting scientist of the Deutsches Bergbau-Museum Bochum. He gained expertise in ancient copper smelting technologies and stable metal isotopes. In addition, he is member of the GlobaLID Core Team and developer of the R package ChronochRt.
