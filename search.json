    "section": "The journey",
    "text": "The journey\nThe idea for the workshop was born in 2016 in an discussion about why so few ECRs are joining the German archaeological sciences conference “Archäometrie & Denkmalpflege” (Archaeometry & preservation of historic monuments). Beside the psychological barrier of delivering the first conference presentation in front of very distinguished researchers, it was realised that the archaeological sciences are often dispersed among many different institutes and work groups, making it very difficult for ECRs to get in contact with peers.\nSince the first workshop in Frankfurt in 2017, all YRA workshops stayed true to the original idea. While originally aiming for the German community, the workshops became soon orientated towards an international audience with about 50% of the participants in the second edition being internationals. Already in 2019, it became an international workshop series with being organised at an institution outside of Germany for the first time. The latest step is to purposefully keep the hybrid format to become more inclusive to colleagues unable to attend the workshop in person while keeping the benefits of in-person meetings for networking.\nWith every new edition, the structures for YRA became more and more professionalised. Beginning with the processing of abstracts and registration in 2019, followed by the logo, mail address and a first webpage in 2022 and resulting in this webpage and the mailing list in 2023. Consequently, workload shifted more and more towards the local organisation while templates now exist for most other tasks. This, and the active support from previous organisers whenever needed, makes the YRA workshops particularly suited to gather first experiences as workshop organiser. And it is what keeps YRA staying true to its motto: for ECRs by ECRs.\nIf you are interested in organising the next workshop or have ideas for additional events, please get in touch via mail."

    "text": "The YRA logo\nDesigning a logo for YRA was not an easy task. Without doubt, the biggest challenge was to create a logo that represents the huge breadth of disciplines working together in the archaeological sciences and represents the target group. As a consequence, decisions were made for a very abstract logo and we are aware it is not very intuitive.\nThe logo writes “YRA” embedded in a spectra-like line with each letter having a different colour and the grey coloured parts as connecting lines. The trowel-shaped arrows outline the negative space (“hole”) of the letters R and A and are inspired by the markers for characteristic peaks. The colours do not have a special meaning. They were chosen because this combination is colour-blind friendly and pleasing to the eyes of the persons involved in the design process."

For her PhD research, defended in November 2022, Kyriaki combined different archaeobotanical and scientific techniques in understanding the agricultural and domestic economies of Classical Sikyon (Greece). During her PhD studies, she was fully embedded in the field team, designing recovery protocols, supervising recovery in the field, and analysing resulting material, thereby becoming an expert in the flora of the Aegean and the current models of the economy and social organization of the first millennium BCE.  Throughout her PhD studies she was also awarded two Erasmus+ Programs; one took place in 2018, in the School of Archaeology of the University of Oxford and the second in 2021 in the Humana, IMF-SCIC Institute, in Barcelona. Both Erasmus programs focused on microbotanical studies and specifically the analysis of starch granules retrieved from the interior of ceramic pots, in order to reconstruct cooking and consumption patterns in the 1st millennium BCE in Greece. She has also held the British School of Athens Centenary Bursary in order to conduct similar research in Oxford related to the Keros research and excavation project of the University of Cambridge (2019).  In MedisFood, Kyriaki holds a Post-Doctorate position where she explores the long durée of plant choices of the 3rd/2nd millennium BCE, the varieties of grapes and olives exploited in the biggest islands of the Eastern Mediterranean, Crete and Cyprus, and addresses key questions related to the rise of complex societies in both islands. The simultaneous analysis of both islands allows not only the understanding of the unique social and agricultural structures of each island, but also the definition of patterns and tendencies that may have appeared at the same time on both regions and which may reflect adaptations, influences and ultimately connections with other areas, or even directly between Crete and Cyprus.\n\n\n\nAnna Karligkioti (Cyprus Institute)  Anna is a PhD candidate in Bioarchaeology, funded by the A.G. Leventis Chair for Archaeological Sciences. In her Ph.D titled Biocultural transformations in central mainland Greece from the Classical to the Roman era, under the supervision of Associate Professor E. Nikita, Anna is combining osteoarchaeological evidence, mortuary data and historical information, aiming to examine biocultural determinants of identity and social differentiation, expressed through health inequalities, differential access to dietary resources, genetic affiliation and activity patterns in the Greco-Roman world. Anna joined the Cyprus Institute in July 2018 after studying Prehistoric Archaeology at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece (2018), Human Osteology and Funerary Archaeology at the University of Sheffield, UK (2014) and History and Archaeology at the University of Ioannina, Greece (2010). Since then, she got engaged with projects examining population dynamics and mobility of past populations, spanning classical and late antiquity until post-medieval/Ottoman era Cyprus. In addition, she is currently a research associate at the Phaleron Bioarchaeology project of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens in Greece.\n\n\n\nChase Minos (Cyprus Institute)  Chase is a PhD candidate in the Science and Technology in Archaeology and Culture Research Centre. He completed his undergraduate degree at the University of St Andrews, and has an MPhil from the University of Cambridge as well as an MSc in experimental archaeology from University College Dublin. Chase is currently a Marie Skłodowska-Curie doctoral fellow part of the premodern plasters and ceramics international training network (PlaCe-ITN). In his PhD, he investigates how raw materials and clay recipes were affected by the use of a new technology, the potter’s wheel, during the Late Bronze Age on Cyprus, and uses an integrated approach involving thin-section petrography, chemical analyses and experimental archaeology.\n\n\n\nThomas Rose (Goethe-Universität Frankfurt)  Thomas is a coordinator in the NDFI4Earth at Goethe University Frankfurt and visiting scientist of the Deutsches Bergbau-Museum Bochum. He gained expertise in ancient copper metallurgy with focus on the Chalcolithic Southern Levant and various metal isotope systems. In addition, he is member of the GlobaLID Core Team and developer of the R package ChronochRt.
