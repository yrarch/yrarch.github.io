Indeed, in Taiwan and the Philippines, there is no mention of a Bronze and Iron Age but of a Metal Age (or directly an Iron Age) since iron, copper-based, glass and precious metal technologies seem to appear together in archaeological context. The first signs of metallurgy in the island contexts of Taiwan and the Philippines appear to have followed similar patterns; no Bronze Age, no sign of primary production, only secondary production and where maritime exchange is a central issue in the development of these technologies. Metallurgy would probably have reached the islands through maritime contacts with mainland Southeast Asia, where metallurgical practices took place earlier (11-13th BC) and maritime contacts have been known since the Neolithic period, notably through nephrite objects. Current evidence seems to support that Taiwan and the Philippines did not have any primary production of copper during the Metal Age but still needs to be proved by future studies. It has been proposed that raw materials and some finish objects were imported. However, secondary production activities are attested with molds, both in Taiwan and the Philippines.\nCopper and its alloys are one of the materials thought to come from the maritime interactions and thus represent an important proxy to study the movements of goods/communities/technologies between the different areas around the South China Sea. Regarding the similarities observed between Taiwan and the Philippines as well as the ancient exchanges attested between the two areas, the current project aims to collect data in order to start discussing the copper-based traditions and the potential exchange networks. We also hope that the data can contribute to understand the origin, timing and development of copper-based metallurgy in Taiwan and the Philippines and its link to other regions for the acquisition of raw materials/finish objects. Around 50 scientific samples, mainly in Taiwan so far, have been collected to be studied following an archaeometric approach (Optical Microscopy, SEM-EDS and ongoing lead isotope analyses). In Taiwan, the current results show that artefacts are diverse, both in terms of their forms (such as bells, vessels, knife handles, Chinese coins, unidentified fragments) and composition (alloys), including bronze, leaded-bronze, high-tin bronze, unalloyed copper, leaded copper and brass. Some artefacts result probably from oversea exports. In Taiwan, differences can also be observed between sites, probably as a result of the different metallurgical practices identified during the excavations, such as secondary production activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 1st – Alkiviadis Sideridis (University of Athens, Greece)\n\n\n\n\n\nTime: 8:00 am (UTC)\nTitle: Tinos’ lost ancient serpentinite quarry (Cyclades, Greece): an interdisciplinary approach.\nKeywords: Stone analysis; Serpentinite; Cyclades Greece; Ancient quarry\nAbstract: The study of marble and coloured-stone production centres of antiquity carries a significant role in the scientific community, being a subject where natural and archaeological sciences may interweave, aiming to decipher quarrying methods, trade and the unique geological fingerprint of the stones.

We are aware of the difficulty to define the term “early career”. As such, we attempt to take into account the varied backgrounds and situations of researchers coming from diverse scientific communities and countries. After some discussion in early 2024, we agreed on the definition of ECRs as researchers up to 6 years after completion of their PhD without a permanent position, such as a lectureship or professorship."

    "section": "The journey",
    "text": "The journey\nThe idea for the workshop began in 2016 in a discussion about why so few ECRs are joining the German archaeological sciences conference “Archäometrie & Denkmalpflege” (Archaeometry & preservation of historic monuments). Besides the psychological barrier of delivering the first conference presentation in front of very distinguished researchers, it was realised that the archaeological sciences are often dispersed among many different institutes and work groups, making it very difficult for ECRs to get in contact with peers.\nSince the first workshop in Frankfurt in 2017, all YRA workshops stayed true to the original idea. While originally aiming for the German community, the workshops soon became orientated towards an international audience with about 50% of the participants in the second edition being internationals. Already in 2019, it became an international workshop series organised at an institution outside of Germany for the first time. The latest step was to purposefully keep the hybrid format to become more inclusive to colleagues unable to attend the workshop in person while keeping the benefits of in-person meetings for networking.\nWith every new edition, the structures for YRA have become more and more professionalised. Beginning with the processing of abstracts and registration in 2019, this was followed by the logo, mail address, and a first webpage in 2022, the last of which resulted in this webpage and the mailing list in 2023. Consequently, workload shifted more and more towards the local organisation while templates now exist for most other tasks. This, and the active support from previous organisers whenever needed, makes the YRA workshops particularly suited to gather first experiences as workshop organiser. This is what keeps YRA true to its motto: for ECRs by ECRs.\nSo, what’s new? Starting in 2024, the YRA will organise a seminar series with lectures from fellow ECRs on a wide range of topics in archaeological science that are featured in the workshops.\nIf you are interested in organising the next workshop or have ideas for additional events, please get in touch via mail."

    "text": "The YRA logo\nDesigning a logo for YRA was not an easy task. Without a doubt, the biggest challenge was to create a logo that represents the huge breadth of disciplines working together in the archaeological sciences and represents the target group. Given the interdisciplinary ethos of the YRA workshops, it was decided that an abstract logo would be the most suitable.\nThe logo writes “YRA” embedded in a spectra-like line with each letter having a different colour and the grey coloured parts as connecting lines. The trowel-shaped arrows outline the negative space (“hole”) of the letters R and A and are inspired by the markers for characteristic peaks. The colours do not have a special meaning. They were chosen because this combination is colour-blind friendly and pleasing to the eyes of the persons involved in the design process."

For her PhD research, defended in November 2022, Kyriaki combined different archaeobotanical and scientific techniques in understanding the agricultural and domestic economies of Classical Sikyon (Greece). During her PhD studies, she was fully embedded in the field team, designing recovery protocols, supervising recovery in the field, and analysing resulting material, thereby becoming an expert in the flora of the Aegean and the current models of the economy and social organization of the first millennium BCE.\nThroughout her PhD studies she was also awarded two Erasmus+ Programs; one took place in 2018, in the School of Archaeology of the University of Oxford and the second in 2021 in the Humana, IMF-SCIC Institute, in Barcelona. Both Erasmus programs focused on microbotanical studies and specifically the analysis of starch granules retrieved from the interior of ceramic pots, in order to reconstruct cooking and consumption patterns in the 1st millennium BCE in Greece. She has also held the British School of Athens Centenary Bursary in order to conduct similar research in Oxford related to the Keros research and excavation project of the University of Cambridge (2019).\nIn MedisFood, Kyriaki holds a Post-Doctorate position where she explores the long durée of plant choices of the 3rd/2nd millennium BCE, the varieties of grapes and olives exploited in the biggest islands of the Eastern Mediterranean, Crete and Cyprus, and addresses key questions related to the rise of complex societies in both islands. The simultaneous analysis of both islands allows not only the understanding of the unique social and agricultural structures of each island, but also the definition of patterns and tendencies that may have appeared at the same time on both regions and which may reflect adaptations, influences and ultimately connections with other areas, or even directly between Crete and Cyprus."
