Despite the range of ceramic lighting objects found in Minoan excavations (lamps, braziers, cups, incense burners), detailed multi-disciplinary studies are limited. Illumination seems to have been an important aspect in Minoan culture, potentially with characteristics beyond practical purposes, suggested by the shapes and necessity, underpinning sensorial parameters in the choice of fuels and additives used. Systematic sampling and analysis of organic residues in ceramic containers have provided archaeologists with significant insights into the use and processing of natural products in antiquity. However, the potential of molecular spectrochemical methods for the detection of fuels used in lighting devices has not been fully deployed. 
 This paper presents a case study on formulating an analytical protocol using Fluorescence, FTIR, and micro-Raman/SERS spectroscopies, corroborated by GC-MS analysis, to identify key molecular species (biomarkers) in archaeological oils and resins used as fuels or as the oily phase of unguents or perfumes used in illuminating practices. We aim to develop a methodology for analyzing organic fuels used in antiquity in Crete. Samples from modern oils, resins, and aromatic plants across the Mediterranean are examined to refine the protocol, including the generation of spectral libraries for specific compounds and plants. Model samples are subjected to artificial aging to understand degradation pathways and their influence in the generated spectra. 
Ultimately, these experimental results will be applied to study ceramic objects assumed to have been used for lighting from Malia, to better assess Minoan illuminating practices and preferences in materials used for domestic and ceremonial contexts.
