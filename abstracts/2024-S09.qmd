Stable manure preserves well in waterlogged archaeological sediments. The organic refuse provides a wealth of information about the site’s economy, forest resources, and impact on the environment. However, the recognition of middens and manure in sediment layers is not always straightforward. In the case study of the Late Neolithic pile dwelling Mooswinkel at the lake Mondsee in Austria, dung, botanical macro- and microremains, as well as invertebrates identified the sediment as stable manure from goat, sheep and cattle farming. Furthermore, the season of the layer formation could be recognized. Materials investigated included pollen, bryophytes, plant fruits and seeds, leaves, branches and bud scales of woody plants, as well as insect remains. In addition, plant microremains in dung were analysed. The results of this multi-material study show that leaf hay and grass hay were used as fodder during the winter season. The impact of fodder acquisition and pasturing on the forest could be reconstructed, showing the formation of a mosaic landscape of natural and semi-natural habitats.
