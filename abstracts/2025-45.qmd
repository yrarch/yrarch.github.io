Landscape Geochemistry is based on the principle of mobility of chemical elements in the face of the action of water in weathering. From this perspective, based on an interactive dynamic with the climatic conditions and mineralogical composition of each environment, the proportion between these elements varies according to the environment, thus producing distinct geochemical signatures. Based on this, the present work aims to present the application of Geochemistry in the aggradational deposits of the Coréia Archaeological Complex, in Morro do Chapéu, Bahia (Brazil), to debate the provenance of the analyzed material, as well as to infer possible formative scenarios for the lateritic deposits. The technique used to explore the chemical characteristics of the sedimentary deposits in question was X-ray Fluorescence, which aims to analyse the sediment in search of its composition and elemental percentage; through this, geochemical indexes were applied to understand whether the sediment layers have an autochthonous (eluvial) or allochthonous (colluvial) origin. Furthermore, it is possible to extend the analysis to the fractional parts of the analysed sediments, which allowed a deeper inference about the chemical maturity of the profile and the formation of the laterites that make up its lower layer, as well as its relationship with the surrounding lithology of the region. Thus, it was possible to outline a context in which the two types of lithofacies overlap, leading to the formation of laterites and iron crusts with a high level of chemical maturity in a mostly semi-arid context with pulses of greater humidity.
