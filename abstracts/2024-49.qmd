The goal of this research is to create a comparative catalogue of raw materials and clays from the northern Tuscany region (Italy) used in fine wares, which will serve as a reference database for determining the provenance of archaeological fine wares. Coarse-ware ceramics are generally easier to trace back to their place of origin compared to fine wares, as the latter contain less petrographic information. To address this challenge, a systematic clay sampling campaign was conducted, collecting samples from outcrops near well-known production centers in the north-western Tuscany. 
This paper presents the clay processing workflow and preliminary results from XRF and XRD analyses of the raw materials. A multi-analytical approach will be further adopted, involving the study of experimental briquettes fired at various temperature ranges using optical microscopy (OM) to complement the minero-petrographic analysis. Additionally, cathodoluminescence on thin sections will be performed at the Arch√©osciences Laboratory of the University of Bordeaux Montaigne. 
This catalogue is part of a broader project aimed at reconstructing the sets of vessels used between the 7th and 10th centuries AD in north Tuscany, as well as understanding the trading dynamics of that period. Determining the provenance and distribution of these ceramics is crucial, as the movement of archaeological ceramics from their production centers to their find spots is related to various human activities such as trade, exchange, and mobility. Therefore, identifying the origins of both coarse-wares and fine-wares can provide significant insights into historical trade patterns.
