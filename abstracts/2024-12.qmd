This paper explores Mamluk pottery, dated to the 13th to 16th centuries CE, concerning the archaeometrical study of Mamluk pottery. It combines materials (lab work) with textual analysis to reconstruct the social and economic ties between two late-medieval rural archaeological sitesâ€”Shawbak, and Khirbet Shbeikeh in Petra Valley, Jordan. Through its ceramic assemblages, with a particular focus on the study of rural social networks through pottery. This is crucial for our understanding of the overall glazed pottery industry during the Mamluk period, especially in terms the differences between urban and rural areas. The ultimate question of this study is whether there was local production of pottery wares at Shawbak and Khirbet Shbeikeh during this period. This, in turn, links to broader issues of rural vs. urban production and their bearing on the wide distribution of ceramics in the Middle Islamic period across the region. 
I analyzed 28 samples of Middle Islamic pottery wares excavated at Shawbak and Khirbet Shbeikhe by petrography (thin section), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF). In addition, stratigraphy and geological survey studies are extensively consulted. The results indicate that there were different workshops and/or sources of pottery wares to provide the archaeological sites of Shawbak and Khirbet Shbeikhe with these profound important objects of daily use.
