The firing process is important in brick manufacturing that significantly impacts their durability and reflects the technological expertise and craftsmanship of historical artisans. This study examines the firing temperature range of a brick material from the ruins of a 19th-century church convent in Quipayo, Camarines Sur, Philippines. To elucidate the mineralogical and chemical composition of the bricks, we employed a variety of analytical techniques, including energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results indicated that the bricks were fired in an oxidizing atmosphere at a temperature range from 900°C to 1100°C. These findings provide essential baseline chemical data on historical and archaeological bricks, enhancing our understanding of their provenance and manufacturing processes.
