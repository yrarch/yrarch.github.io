The technological approach to Neolithic ceramics, particularly from the Tell Neolithic facies identified at Gueldamen 1 site (Béjaïa) and (Oran) (in northwestern of Algeria), which corresponds to the Mediterranean Neolithic, remains insufficiently defined. This is especially true for ceramic collections dated between 7000 and 4000 years before present, which are often studied using a predominantly typo-stylistic approach.
In this paper, we present the methods used for the technological analysis of pottery from various Neolithic sites in northern Algeria, whether or not they were recovered in a stratigraphic context. Our objective is to offer a diachronic interpretation of ceramic manufacturing techniques throughout the Neolithic occupation of the region.
The studied assemblage does not include any complete vessels. Therefore, our reconstruction of the chaîne opératoire relies on the morpho-stylistic and technological analysis of ceramic fragments. Macroscopic examination of technical traces has revealed the existence of several operational sequences, particularly in the shaping of different parts of the vessels.
After identifying and presenting these variants, we propose interpretive perspectives based on comparative data obtained through radiographic studies of complete vessels from other contemporary sites. The findings raise new questions concerning the indigenous nature of these manufacturing techniques and the potential influence of other cultural facies.
