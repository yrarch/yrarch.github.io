After the Last Glacial Maximum, ameliorating climates facilitated the recolonization of Central Europe by human and animal groups. Petersfels, situated in the Hegau Jura of southwestern Germany, evidences the later stages of this repopulation, dating to ~16-14 ka cal BP. Over the past hundred years, numerous excavations at the site have revealed an exceptional record of Magdalenian subsistence including abundant lithic and osseous material, personal ornaments, engravings, and female figurines. Faunal remains are particularly relevant, as they archive information on human and animal lifeways as well as the broader post-LGM environmental context. However, despite this great potential, little is known about the paleoecological context of the site or the broader Hegau Jura. Here, we present new biomolecular analyses of the Petersfels faunal assemblage, which help to illuminate the paleoecology of the region. Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS) was applied to identify rare taxa and to differentiate between closely related species. We also conducted stable isotope analyses of carbon (δ^13^C) and oxygen (δ^18^O) from serially sampled equid and bovid tooth enamel carbonate. The latter contributes to our understanding of local paleoecology during the Magdalenian and the status of human and animal communities during post-LGM climatic change. More broadly, this work shows how heritage collections like Petersfels are still immensely valuable, especially with the application of modern biomolecular techniques.
