The Timna Valley in southern Israel has evidence of metallurgical activity spanning 7000 years and is one of the best-preserved ancient copper mining and smelting regions in the world. As part of the Central Timna Valley Project (CTV, https://www.tau.ac.il/~ebenyose/CTV/) we attempt to assess major technological developments from the longue-durée perspective, focusing on smelting activities and its most common byproduct, slag. In the current study, we test the hypothesis that the proportion of the slag’s glassy phase constitutes an additional proxy for different smelting technologies, assuming that in more advanced technologies the percentage of glass would be higher, due to higher temperatures, improved reducing conditions, lower viscosity and more efficient tapping. We analyzed three slag samples from five smelting sites corresponding to five distinct copper production periods; the Early Bronze Age, Late Bronze Age, Iron Age I, Iron Age IIA and Early Islamic Period. To characterize the quantity and quality of glass within the slag samples, our research applied two main disciplines, including metallography, analyzed as epoxied cross-sectioned samples through SEM-EDS and crystallography, analyzed as powdered samples with XRD. Preliminary results, produced during the first half of 2024, have so far supported our hypothesis regarding the glassy phase, with a clear difference between non-tapping and tapping technologies. The research is still ongoing with further analyses, observations and conclusions expected in the coming months.
