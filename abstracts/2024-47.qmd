Are all archaeological resources cultural heritage? Should tourists be allowed on archaeological sites? There are ongoing debates about transforming archaeological sites into tourist destinations. The major concern is how this can be done responsibly without jeopardizing the archaeological essence of the sites due to traffic, which may lead to destruction. Also, the question of archaeological resources being heritage is of great concern because most host/local communities do not view archaeological sites as their heritage. Yet, archaeological inquiries in Ile-Ife in the past century have unravelled tremendous evidence on the robust past of Ile-Ife in science and technology, political and social organization, craft specialization, religious complexity, as well as its contribution to global civilization. This study aims at harmonizing Archaeology, cultural heritage, and Tourism in Ile-Ife for the purpose of promoting and preserving the memories of the past. Reviewing archaeological works in the city, the paper reassesses the state of the art with the view to establishing a connection with cultural heritage. Tourism is a fast-growing industry globally that not only generates revenue for the host/local communities and nations but also serves as the conduit through which heritage knowledge is preserved and disseminated. Thus, this paper also discusses how tourism as practice in the 21st century can be a unifier rather than a destroyer of archaeological resources and cultural heritage in Ile-Ife.
