Non-sign symbols in the Harappan civilisation are complex archaeological narratives crossing the linguistic divisions in the cultural landscapes beyond the civilisation's unwritten intellectual and cultural grammar. Categorisation of Harappan symbols as linguistic signs and non-sign elements will be done. The non-sign elements comprise cultural motifs such as concentric squares, swastika-like symbols, and peepal leaf designs. The study unveils potential communicative and cultural networks embedded within archaeological artefacts by systematically documenting and analysing these symbolic variations.  The methodology uses Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to create a comprehensive database of non-linguistic symbolic representations found on archaeological artefacts. The study employs comparative analysis integrating scholarly perspectives. Existing literature reveals significant variations in symbolic distributions across Harappan settlements, suggesting potential cultural, communicative, and network implications. The research offers an innovative methodological approach toward understanding non-linguistic communication systems, forming a foundational framework for an interdisciplinary archaeological semiotics approach, and it provides a distinct view into the symbolic dimensions of Harappan material culture.
