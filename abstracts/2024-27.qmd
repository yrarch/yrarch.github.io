During the period of Roman Influence (1st-3rd century AD), in Poland existed three large metallurgical centers of the Przeworsk culture: Świętokrzyskie, Silesian and Masovian. These centers were famous for their large-scale iron production. The ore was fired in clay furnaces resembling chimneys, which were filled with coal and ore in layers. 
In the Świętokrzyskie Mountains, experimental research reconstructing the iron smelting process has been taking place since the 1950s. Experimental research was carried out there, including physico-chemical research, to help analyze the iron smelting process at the atomic level. In Masovia, experiments focused primarily on the design aspects of the furnace chimney. 
This project focuses on the chemical-physical composition of bog iron ore. The ore will be tested for its elemental composition. The results will be compared with the ore found at mining sites from the 2nd century AD. The analysis will show whether there are differences in the elemental composition of the iron age and modern ore and how it affects the experimental results.
