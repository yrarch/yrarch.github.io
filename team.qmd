Anna (Cyprus Institute) is a PhD candidate in Bioarchaeology, funded by the A.G. Leventis Chair for Archaeological Sciences. In her Ph.D titled *Biocultural transformations in central mainland Greece from the Classical to the Roman era*, under the supervision of Associate Professor E. Nikita, Anna is combining osteoarchaeological evidence, mortuary data and historical information, aiming to examine biocultural determinants of identity and social differentiation, expressed through health inequalities, differential access to dietary resources, genetic affiliation and activity patterns in the Greco-Roman world. Anna joined the Cyprus Institute in July 2018 after studying Prehistoric Archaeology at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece (2018), Human Osteology and Funerary Archaeology at the University of Sheffield, UK (2014) and History and Archaeology at the University of Ioannina, Greece (2010). Since then, she got engaged with projects examining population dynamics and mobility of past populations, spanning classical and late antiquity until post-medieval/Ottoman era Cyprus. In addition, she is currently a research associate at the Phaleron Bioarchaeology project of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens in Greece.

## Kyriaki Tsirtsi [![](https://info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/orcid_16x16.png)](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1861-7987)

Kyriaki (Cyprus Institute) has extensive experience in archaeobotanical research, both in the field and in the laboratory. For her PhD research, defended in November 2022, Kyriaki combined different archaeobotanical and scientific techniques in understanding the agricultural and domestic economies of Classical Sikyon (Greece). During her PhD studies, she was fully embedded in the field team, designing recovery protocols, supervising recovery in the field, and analysing resulting material, thereby becoming an expert in the flora of the Aegean and the current models of the economy and social organization of the first millennium BCE. 

Throughout her PhD studies she was also awarded two Erasmus+ Programs; one took place in 2018, in the School of Archaeology of the University of Oxford and the second in 2021 in the Humana, IMF-SCIC Institute, in Barcelona. Both Erasmus programs focused on microbotanical studies and specifically the analysis of starch granules retrieved from the interior of ceramic pots, in order to reconstruct cooking and consumption patterns in the 1st millennium BCE in Greece. She has also held the British School of Athens Centenary Bursary in order to conduct similar research in Oxford related to the Keros research and excavation project of the University of Cambridge (2019). 

In MedisFood, Kyriaki holds a Post-Doctorate position where she explores the long durée of plant choices of the 3^rd^/2^nd^ millennium BCE, the varieties of grapes and olives exploited in the biggest islands of the Eastern Mediterranean, Crete and Cyprus, and addresses key questions related to the rise of complex societies in both islands. The simultaneous analysis of both islands allows not only the understanding of the unique social and agricultural structures of each island, but also the definition of patterns and tendencies that may have appeared at the same time on both regions and which may reflect adaptations, influences and ultimately connections with other areas, or even directly between Crete and Cyprus.
