## How to get to Tübingen

Tübingen is a university city in south-western Germany, at the centre of the state Baden-Württemberg. It is located ca. 30 km south of Stuttgart, the state capital.

You can easily access Tübingen via direct train from Stuttgart central station (IRE6, MEX12, and MEX18), or via bus lines 828 and X82 from Stuttgart Airport (STR). You can find information about connections with trains and regional buses [here](https://www.bahn.com/en). Several long distance bus lines operated by e.g. [Flixbus](https://www.flixbus.de/) stop at Tübingen. With a car you reach Tübingen best via the B27 and B28. 

YRA 2023 will take place in [Hohentübingen Castle](https://goo.gl/maps/WivDsmVgp2eYTCGs5), in Tübingen’s historical city centre. Please be aware that the castle is located on a small but steep hill. Access for persons with reduced mobility is possible but require arrangements in advance regarding e.g. parking. Please [contact us](mailto:youngresearchersarch@gmail.com) if this should be the case. We are happy to make all necessary arrangements for you.
