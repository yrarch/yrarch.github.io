## Call for Abstracts

We are happy to announce that the **6^th^ Workshop Young Researchers in Archaeometry** will be held in **hybrid format** at the **University of Tübingen**, Germany from **October 4^th^ to 6^th^, 2023**. The workshop will once again welcome early career researchers (master, PhD, first postdoc) in archaeological sciences and cultural heritage studies.

With this workshop we aim to offer a relaxed atmosphere to encourage interdisciplinary exchange between early career researchers. With a hybrid format, we are happy to welcome participants in person, as well as those online from all around the world, who cannot come to Tübingen. We are pleased to invite you for oral contributions in all kinds of natural sciences about archaeological and anthropological topics. In particular, early career researchers in archaeology, art history, anthropology, biology, chemistry, conservation, cultural heritage, earth science, material science, medicine, physics are welcome to submit an abstract.
-->

## Financial support by the GNAA

For the participation in presence at the workshop, members of the Gesellschaft für Naturwissenschaftliche Archäologie ARCHAEOMETRIE e.V. ([GNAA](www.archaeometrie.de){target="_blank"}) as students (Bachelor, Master, Diploma, Doctorate) receive a subsidy of 30 € upon presentation of the corresponding confirmation of participation. This also applies if you currently become a member of the GNAA.

For this purpose, the confirmation of participation in the workshop must be submitted to the GNAA by e-mail with the bank account data and the GNAA membership number or an application for a corresponding GNAA membership.

## How to get to Tübingen

Tübingen is a university city in south-western Germany, at the centre of the state Baden-Württemberg. It is located ca. 30 km south of Stuttgart, the state capital.

You can easily access Tübingen via direct train from Stuttgart central station (IRE6, MEX12, and MEX18), or via bus lines 828 and X82 from Stuttgart Airport (STR). You can find information about connections with trains and regional buses [here](https://www.bahn.com/en){target="_blank"}. Several long distance bus lines operated by e.g. [Flixbus](https://www.flixbus.de/){target="_blank"} stop at Tübingen. With a car you reach Tübingen best via the B27 and B28. 

YRA 2023 will take place in [Hohentübingen Castle](https://goo.gl/maps/WivDsmVgp2eYTCGs5){target="_blank"}, in Tübingen’s historical city centre. Please be aware that the castle is located on a small but steep hill. Access for persons with reduced mobility is possible but require arrangements in advance regarding e.g. parking. Please [contact us](mailto:youngresearchersarch@gmail.com) if this should be the case. We are happy to make all necessary arrangements for you. 

## Code of conduct
