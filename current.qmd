We are happy to announce that the 8^th^ Workshop Young Researchers in Archaeometry will be held at the Eötvös Loránd University, in Budapest, Hungary. The conference will be held in person from October 14^th^ to 17^th^, 2025 and will welcome early career researchers (masters, PhD, post-docs up to six years after their PhD) in archaeological sciences and cultural heritage studies.

With this workshop, we aim to offer a relaxed atmosphere to encourage interdisciplinary exchange between early career researchers. We are pleased to invite you for oral and poster contributions in all fields of natural sciences about archaeological and anthropological topics. In particular, early career researchers in archaeology, art history, anthropology, biological anthropology, environmental archaeology, chemistry, conservation, cultural heritage, earth science, and material science are welcome to submit an abstract for an oral presentation or poster.

Participation will come at a cost but we do our best to keep the fee as low as possible. In the last years, YRA managed to keep workshop fees well below 50 €.

## SAS Travel Award 

The [Society for Archaeological Sciences](https://socarchsci.org) (SAS) sponsors a single travel award of USD 250 to support one student/ECR from [low and middle income countries](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups) and/or with financial need.    

The application for the SAS Travel award is integrated in the [abstract submission form](https://forms.gle/txhdzYgtvHt5LEoh6). Applications will be evaluated after abstract submission closed. The evaluation will be based on the applicant's career status, location of affiliation, availability of alternative funding sources, and an motivation letter of 200 to 250 words. The SAS Travel Award will only be bestowed to an applicant with an abstract accepted for presentation at YRA2025.
