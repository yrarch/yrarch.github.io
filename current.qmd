We are happy to announce that the 8^th^ Workshop Young Researchers in Archaeometry will be held at the Eötvös Loránd University, in Budapest, Hungary. The conference will be held in person from October 14^th^ to 17^th^, 2025 and will welcome early career researchers (masters, PhD, post-docs up to six years after their PhD) in archaeological sciences and cultural heritage studies.

With this workshop, we aim to offer a relaxed atmosphere to encourage interdisciplinary exchange between early career researchers. We are pleased to invite you for oral and poster contributions in all fields of natural sciences about archaeological and anthropological topics. In particular, early career researchers in archaeology, art history, anthropology, biological anthropology, environmental archaeology, chemistry, conservation, cultural heritage, earth science, and material science are welcome to submit an abstract for an oral presentation or poster.

## Registration
Please register through [this form](https://forms.gle/vJCm7feYgBijP4FGA). Registration is possible for everyone, also if you are not presenting. Workshop fees are 30 €. SAS members receive a 5 € discount; you can join SAS before 15 September to benefit from the discount.
