## A workshops series for ECRs by ECRs

YRA aims to give early career researchers (ECRs) in archaeometry the opportunity to present their research in a friendly environment surrounded only by young students from the same field. We welcome all persons involved in archaeometry research of different nationalities and levels, from master students to first postdoctoral fellows.
